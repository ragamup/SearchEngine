The UNT Vice President for Research and Innovation serves as the Deciding Official and appoints the members of the Inquiry Committee and the Investigation Committee. Dr. Thomas McCoy, the UNT Vice President for Research and Innovation serves as the Research Integrity Officer and has the primary responsibility for implementation of the procedures under the UNT Research Misconduct Policy. Research misconduct is defined in the Policy as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. Plagiarism is the appropriation of another persons ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion. Any observed, suspected, or apparent research misconduct may be reported to the Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation, the Vice President for Research and Innovation, or the Office of the General Counsel.
