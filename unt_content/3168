visual and sonic artist, video director and performer exploring cross-media synthesis and interdisciplinary approaches to new genres bridging the arts, design and sciences. He is a recipient of the New Mexico New Visions Award (2007), the Harvestworks Interactive Technology Award and the Sun Micro Systems Award for Academic Excellence (2004) and a nominee for the USA Artist Fellowship (2008), International Media Art Prize (2004) and the WTN World Technology Award (2003). He holds a BFA (1980) in Art and Design from the University of Oregon and an inter-school MFA (1985) in Film-Video and Music from the California Institute of the Arts where he studied with Ed Emshwiller, Jules Engel, Joan La Barbara, Jim Pomeroy, Barry Schrader and Bill Viola. His works include live cinema performance, video-dance, experimental film and animation, print-making, mixed media installation, electro-acoustic music composition, sound-art and large-scale telematic video events that emphasize multi-screen projection as an extension of performer, audience and architecture. Since 2002 he has worked closely with creative partner, Cory Metcalf to examine the aesthetic possibilities for evolutionary generative systems, artificial life networks and simulation environments. The pair are renowned as members of the audio-visual performance group, NoiseFold, a critically acclaimed interactive media ensemble. NoiseFold presented their world premiere at the Festival Internationale d’Art Video in Casablanca, Morocco in spring 2006. Their performances, which have included the UNESCO Creative Cities Summit, the New York Electronic Arts Festival, Interactive Futures in Victoria, BC and “Chinati Weekend” in Marfa, Texas have garnered ecstatic reviews and a growing international audience. Stout has previously held teaching positions at CalArts, The Savannah College of Art & Design and The College of Santa Fe. While in Santa Fe he founded the Installation, Performance & Interactivity project (IPI) and the MOV-iN Gallery, an experimental exhibition space devoted to interactive media works including Sound-Art, Robotics, Web-Art, Interactive Video Installation and other emergent transdisciplinary art forms. David is presently on the board of directors of the Santa Fe Complex, an organization dedicated to collaborative research and design that fosters applied complexity science through interdisciplinary education, outreach, and technology innovation. As a Professor and Research Artist with the Initiative for Advance Research in Technology and the Arts (iARTA), David works across the arts and technology disciplines to forge new curricular and research relationships among UNT students, faculty, guest artists-scholars and other academic partners and organizations.
