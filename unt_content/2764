Earlier this semester, 35 students came together to build Little Free Pantries that will be installed around the Denton community. The day of service was organized by PACE as part of the college’s Hungry For Change initiative. The Little Free Pantry (LFP) is a full-circle community effort to help those who aren’t easily able to meet everyday food and personal needs. Those in need are able to approach the LFP freely at any time of day to take anything they need, whether it be food or personal items. Those who want to give are just as easily able to approach the LFP and leave whatever items they desire. The LFP silences the stigma and shame that divides folks who give and folks who need.
