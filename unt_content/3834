Pause and relax at Paws & Relax on May 9 from 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. in Willis Library Forum and interact with well-trained, adorable therapy dogs. The dogs, trained at Paws Across Texas will be in there to offer their big toothy smiles and wagging tails to students who need a break.  Paws Across Texas is a Fort Worth-based nonprofit organization that provides therapy programs by working with volunteers and their privately owned companion animals. All the participating dogs have been specially trained to be calm while accepting belly rubs and being petted by students, and information regarding their shots has been shared with the Library. Students must sign a waiver stating they have no known allergies before petting the dogs. This is the organization's seventh semester to collaborate with UNT Libraries on this event, with hundreds of participants giving glowing reviews. The event is sponsored by the UNT Student Library Advisory Boards.
