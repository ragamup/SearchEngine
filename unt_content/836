"We believe our new partnership with the Dallas Cowboys will increase awareness of UNT, and we're excited about the educational opportunities our students will have interacting with one of the top sports franchises in the world," said UNT President Neal Smatresk. The promotional program provides UNT a significant presence at AT&T Stadium, and The Star, the Cowboys World Headquarters, along with the Ford Center at The Star. The Star in Frisco is located directly across from the UNT New College in Frisco, an off-site instructional facility that UNT opened in January 2016. There is a natural alignment between many of UNT's academic programs and the diverse aspects of the Cowboys multifaceted organization. The educational portion of the program will bring Dallas Cowboys executives into UNT classrooms and provide UNT students opportunities for working projects and internships. These alignments will give the Cowboys access to some of the best-trained critical thinkers and business leaders of tomorrow in many fields – and UNT students will receive valuable experience that will better prepare them for successful careers. The Dallas Cowboys are the most-valuable sports franchise in the U.S., consistently ranked among the most popular across all sports in the country. "As UNT increases its visibility throughout Texas and around the world, we are glad to partner with such a prominent organization," said Smatresk.
