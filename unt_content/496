Online Exclusives 96 comments A Love With Swing We met in fall 1997 in World Literature taught by Dr. Julian Long, held in the GAB, room 105. I always say Ethan sat next to me. He would say he always knew. We spent the semester studying together and having lunch a few days a week after class. We then took the next course, ENGL 2220, together and started dancing at Bruce Hall's Friday night swing. I would say he was just my dance partner. He would say he always knew. I guess looking back, he was right. This August will be 13 years of marriage. We now have a beautiful daughter and are still dancing every chance we get. Thanks for giving us a chance to share our story.

I didn't know a soul at UNT, so the housing department decided that I should share a room with another Greg from Fort Worth. His girlfriend, Cheryl, also a senior at Paschal, was Virgie’s best friend. We would all pal around when Greg went home on weekends. The following school year Virgie and Cheryl roomed at Bruce Hall. My friendship with Virgie blossomed into a romance. We married upon Virgie's graduation. I took a few years longer to complete my degree. We have been married 39 years but friends for 43. We have two children and four beautiful grandchildren. We are living the American dream on some acreage next to Lake Texoma near Pottsboro, Texas.

In the fall semester of 1981, I gazed across the packed, horseshoe-shaped classroom of about 100 people, and my eyes fixed on her. As I stared at her from across the room, her eyes met mine. I winked at her, and she turned away in startled embarrassment and horror. We have been married for 25 years now. Our wedding was held at the Little Chapel in the Woods at Texas Woman’s University, and our wedding reception was held in the Silver Eagle Suite in the University Union building. I love you, North Texas — and you too, Mary!

We both worked in the history help center and history library and quickly formed a friendship. One day we decided we would play racquetball every Thursday at the PEB after work. We quickly realized that we had many common interests besides our love of history, and Ben asked me out on our first date for Valentine's Day. We talked long into the night, and after many more dates, outings to the Denton Square and a few more racquetball matches, we were engaged. As they say, "When you know, you know." We were married on Nov. 19, 2005, at the Dallas Arboretum. After seven wonderful years of marriage, we welcomed our future Eagle, Jase Ellison Hegi, into the world! Even though we no longer live in Denton, we often think about our time there, and at UNT, fondly and would like to move back someday.

I saw it on my way home, went back to campus and got on the bus. We started dating that week, got "unofficially" engaged the next week and were married the next year. Our 24th anniversary is March 11, 2013!

I'd actually met her before in Maple Hall’s dining room, while we were both getting soup. She made fun of my name, and I loved it because it made her smile, little dimples in her cheek. I called her, asked her out for coffee, used the old "It'll help you stay up and study" ruse. I couldn't stop thinking about her. We’ve been married for almost seven years. Catherine graduated in 2005, and I graduated in 2007. Comment #6 posted by Craig A.

We met in classes for Hotel Motel Restaurant Management. Two classes in particular drew us closer and allowed me enough nerve to finally ask her on a date. However, it was a little maneuvering on my part that first allowed me to manipulate the class so that Cynde would be working with or in my group. Quantity Food and Dining Room Management were both classes that were structured so that the students would be in charge of menu planning, food preparation and dining room service. Eventually the reins were put in my hands, and at every opportunity I made sure Cynde would remain in my group. I also had the help of some very good friends: Gina Goertzen, Michelle Dupree, Jacque Calderon and Jeff Rowley. When it was their turn to select the groups, Cynde again was in my group. Fortunately my schemes were never fully revealed, or maybe she just felt sorry for this poor guy trying so hard. We went out on our first date, and two years after graduation we were married. Cynde was actually Outstanding Senior for our class. We are about to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary this year. UNT holds special meaning to our family, and we met some very special friends there, like Dr. Richard Tas, Adrian Domiguez and those mentioned above, all graduates of UNT and the College of Hospitality Management class of 1987.

They met in 1994 while students at UNT — he was football captain and she was a cheerleader and dancer. It was a good year for the Mean Green — the team drew good crowds, had a winning record and ended the season as conference champs, and Greg and Julie fell in love. Greg volunteered as a shot-put coach at Liberty Christian, a small school across the street from UNT. He later completed his education observation hours at Liberty while assistant coaching for the Mean Green. In 1997, he joined Liberty’s football coaching staff. Julie, now engaged to Greg, was not far behind. While at a Liberty football game, she saw that Liberty’s dance program could use some help. She was hired to lead the team and transformed it to the current Danz Team. “UNT is a big part of where we started — our relationship with each other and with Liberty Christian School,” Julie said in an LCS publication. Shortly after, Julie and Greg were married. They have both been at Liberty ever since. Greg was made football head coach and athletic director in 2009. The Prices have two daughters, Jaci and Jordyn. Greg and Julie both appreciate the importance of UNT in their relationship. “Julie and I are both cheerleaders for North Texas,” Greg said in an LCS publication. “We were both voted ‘Most Spirited’ in our respective high school yearbooks. We’re loyal — that’s who we are — and as far as UNT goes, we bleed green. I have not missed many North Texas games in the last 20 years.” Comment #8 posted by Greg ('96) and Julie Price ('99) (not verified) 4 years 11 weeks ago. reply Bourbon Street Bliss My husband and I met at UNT in 2001. He noticed me during an 8 a.m. Music Appreciation class — I wore pajamas and no makeup to class every week. It was not until one evening later in the school year he finally spoke to me. At the time, I thought he was using a cheesy pickup line, but he continued by identifying my exact row and seat from Music Appreciation class. I was impressed, but we did not talk again until the North Texas football team made it to the New Orleans Bowl playoff game. On Bourbon Street we ran into each other again, and this time he introduced himself properly and took hold of my hand as we walked. We have been inseparable ever since!

Love waits with you patiently, comforting you when you are weary, reminding you that your time will come. When my time came, I looked back at love and said, “This was worth the wait.” I became a graduate student at the University of North Texas Mayborn School of Journalism in 2003, and that is when love fulfilled its promise to me. I completed my bachelor’s degree a long time ago, and since then I have been searching for a graduate school that can challenge my skills, add to my education and experience, and embrace me with care and passion. All of the above I found at the green school, the University of North Texas. One can only ascertain the modus operandi of love after it has revealed itself. Love tends to surprise us and catch us when we are not searching for it. It strikes us so quickly, overwhelms us so powerfully and curtails our senses so strongly that it can be frustrating to a person who is love struck and trying to explain it. I stopped trying to explain my love for UNT and decided to simply enjoy this great blessing. I believe that is how love works. UNT embraced me with the same love in return, accepted me for who I was and, like true love tends to do, made me a better professional and a stronger journalist and gave me recognition for my achievements. As a Kuwaiti woman, and as a journalist, my journey to discover this love took me 8,000 miles and 20 years. Being a professional journalist is a difficult and demanding task, made more difficult by the pressures of a culture that, at the time, encouraged me to let go of this dream. But love told me otherwise. It promised me that this journey would be worth my while, constantly reminding me that this effort and time will be rewarded. Eight thousand miles from my relatives, I found my long-lost family. UNT is the family, and it was there, with love in its arms. The green school, UNT, ignited the flame of love in my heart. I was suddenly embraced by professionals who loved their careers, loved to teach and loved those who loved in return. This love made them unforgettable. Curricula, professors, faculty, administrators, friends and various activities captured my breath within the first semester of studying at UNT. Moreover, applying my work experiences in my school papers and tests proved to me that we all live in a small world, and by applying the appropriate media theories and using the suitable technology, the United States will be closer to Kuwait than what geography says is possible. As an international student, I found much more at UNT than simple education. I found a loving home. Now, six years after leaving UNT, I realize the true wisdom to love. Those who love may seem shortsighted. However, after all these years, it remains true, once love is in your heart, your work will have a lasting, positive consciousness that becomes ubiquitous in everything that is you. UNT, your gift of love has given me all that I need to succeed in my profession. Comment #10 posted by Jameela Sayed Ali ('06 M.J.)

He graduated from the College of Music with his Bachelor of Arts in music in 1992, and I graduated from the College of Music with my Bachelor of Arts in music in 1999. Our love story is somewhat less traditional than perhaps my parents would have liked, but we've been together for 16 years and never looked back. My husband LOVES North Texas with a fierce loyalty and pride. In his second year of teaching after graduating from North Texas, he returned to his alma mater high school to become his former band director's assistant director. Coincidentally, I was a senior in that high school band at the time. I was feverishly looking at colleges and beginning the audition process for the upcoming school year. My new, young assistant band director loved telling me about all the wonders of music at UNT. I began to fall in love with the university before I had even stepped foot on campus. Eventually, I did visit the campus, audition and decide that UNT was the school for me. I graduated from high school, left my high school band program and began immersing myself in all the musical opportunities at UNT. I kept in touch with both my high school band directors, visiting each winter break and over the summers. My second summer back, the school hired me to teach with the marching band. Tony and I would spend lunches talking about North Texas. We would exchange stories about music, faculty and campus. As a fourth-year teacher, Tony loved reminiscing about his days at North Texas and was almost wistful about his time there. He made me feel incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to study at UNT and reminded me to savor each day at North Texas. It's easy to take so much for granted when you're in the college-student grind, but Tony was a constant reminder that the years would go quickly and my life would move on to the classroom. Never again would I have as much musical opportunity as I had in my five years at UNT. At some point that summer, Tony and I realized that we really liked each other. We realized that we had so much in common and just seemed to "get" each other. Sparks began to fly. I returned to Denton for the start of the new school year, and we kept in touch by long-distance phone calls. Later that year, Tony came to Denton to spend the weekend with me. He later told me that that weekend sealed our relationship in his mind. Seeing me in my element, living my dream, energized by my environment, he knew that he wanted to keep that energy in his life. Eventually, I graduated from UNT, moved back to my hometown and got a job as the middle school band director at one of the schools that fed into my old high school, where Tony still taught. Four years into my teaching, Tony and I got married. Five years later, our daughter, Evangelina, was born. We're still teaching, making music and forever trying to live with the energy and ideals that UNT created inside us.

Probably because my husband and I met at the University of North Texas’ famed radio station KNTU. I was a swimmer for UNT studying journalism and political science. To gain more experience, I started working at KNTU. I will never forget my first day. I was assigned to do a news update. I found the stories, wrote them up, went into the booth to go live and this sports reporter with a funny last name, Mark Schectman (’05), former KNTU sports guy and first host of the North Texas Jukebox, was sitting in the booth with me. I realized very quickly the one thing I had forgotten: how to turn on the mic. I asked the guy with the funny last name in an urgent, freaked-out voice, “How do you turn on the mic?" He very coolly and calmly reached over and hit the red button that said “on air” and giggled a bit under his breath. Mark and I were married Dec. 15, 2007. Our soundtrack continues and is updated with great songs every day, and Mark continues to turn on the mic every evening as a DJ on 102.1 The Edge in Dallas.

We were introduced by a mutual friend while I was working the front desk at the residence hall. I instantly was attracted to him and we began hanging out. Friendship quickly turned into love. We became engaged two years later and married six months after that. Even though our lives and careers took us away from UNT, we wanted to show our history there, so we had our engagement pictures done on campus. One of my favorite photos is of us in front of the fountain. Two years after our marriage, we welcomed a beautiful daughter named Sophia Grace, and she already has Mean Green pride with her Scrappy eagle.

I knew at first glance there was something different about him when we met. We spoke briefly and I told him that I would be back after my shift was over to meet a friend. One thing I learned going into college not knowing anyone is that you have to take chances to meet new people. So after work I went back to Lucky Lou's to meet up with him, telling him I would just hang out while waiting for a friend to meet me. What he didn't know was there wasn't any friend meeting me there — I just needed a great excuse to go back into Lou's! Although this tactic sounds a bit crazy, it was something I knew I needed to do in case I never saw him again. Six years later with our UNT degrees in hand, awesome jobs and many amazing memories, we are engaged to be married. Many things would not have happened for us throughout our lives if we had not graduated from UNT. For example, Clayton's study abroad for his business degree inspired him to take off a year after school and travel the world. And I wouldn't have had my amazing job opportunities if it had not been for my fashion merchandising internship. Oddly enough my parents met and fell in love at UNT too. This school is a special place for me, my family and many of my lifelong friends.

He and I have only been married for five years, but in those five years much of our lives have been about UNT. He is a Distinguished Alumnus, and he has been on so many boards at UNT, I can't count. Being involved with the university, we are often on campus and involved with administration, volunteers, donors, students and staff. The energy and excitement on campus and at UNT events is infectious. One day we talked to a group about our involvement. Frank spoke about his time on campus as a young student and what UNT meant to him. Big tears welled in his eyes and his voice cracked. The love I have for him and his intense pride in the university made my heart swell. I told the group I was not an alum but an "Alum of the Heart." I simply knew this had been a magical time for him and so many of the 36,000 students UNT serves every day. We attend as many UNT activities as we can, and in 2012 I became a student at UNT. I am going to finish a degree in the Public Affairs and Community Service program, concentrating in non-profit management, so I too will have the same pride Frank has in our great university! I fell in love with my sweet Frank years ago, but now I’m in love with UNT as well.

Naturally we found ourselves enrolled in all the same courses, laughing at all the same jokes and simply drawn toward each other. At the time we had no idea that 10 years later we would be getting married. Over the next two years we shared so many memories together including our graduation date with our degrees in hospitality management in December 2005. Now we’re engaged to be married this June!

I took a seat in the middle of the room and was minding my own business. A few students trickled in, but not many. Of course one of the boys who walked in chose to sit right next to me, rather than in one of MANY empty seats. I’ll admit, at first I was kind of annoyed. Just getting out of a serious relationship, I was still in a "man-hater" stage. As the weeks went on and the group projects started, that boy and I started talking about more than just marketing and realized we were in pretty similar situations and had a lot in common. We met up a few time when out with friends but nothing too serious. I graduated that May, and he accompanied me to my graduation. That was also his first time to meet my family. We continued our relationship through the summer, and I supported him through his last semester at UNT. He graduated in December 2005, moved to Addison and began working at Ernst & Young. In August 2006, he proposed to me while doing what I love: running! We got married in June 2007 and have since moved to my small hometown and have two children, ages 4 and 9 months. We drive through Denton often on our way to visit family, and it always brings back memories of our college days and when our love began!

They had the good fortune of having mutual friends who set them up on a blind date in September 1958 — Ann's first day on the North Texas campus. Obviously the date went well for they continued to date over the next four years before graduating in January (Don) and May (Ann) of 1962. Don played football at NT for a period of time and was a Kappa Sigma while Ann was the Kappa Sigma Sweetheart. Later they shared a traditional Kappa Sigma pinning ceremony in the courtyard of Kendall Hall that was witnessed by hundreds of Kendall residents. They enjoyed many wonderful times together over their years at North Texas. Upon graduation and marriage, both took teaching positions in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford ISD, where they lived, worked and raised their family for the next 39 years. They have one son and one daughter, and three beautiful grandsons. Ann retired after 38 years and Don after 39 years as educators. Ann was a creative and energetic fourth-grade teacher who continues to get praises from former students and parents of students she taught over those years. Don was first a teacher-coach and for 26 years the principal at L.D. Bell High School. He also served as president of the Texas Association of Secondary School Principals, president of the National Association of Secondary School Principals and a founding director of the International Confederation of Principals. They were able to travel around the globe to meet and consult with educators in numerous countries. Don served on numerous study and governing boards across the country to design and support schools searching for better strategies and tools to improve student learning. After his first retirement, Don started his own consulting business in 2001. Over the past 12 years, he has worked with hundreds of school districts, state agencies and individual principals across the United States to improve their craft. “Our love affair was possible because both of us made UNT our school of choice,” Ann said. “Our love affair continues as we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary with dozens of friends and family at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas last summer.” Comment #18 posted by Don ('62, '65 M.Ed.) and Ann Dodson ('62) (not verified) 4 years 11 weeks ago. reply Constitutional Courtship Our love story began, improbably enough, in Dr. Sam B. McAlister's constitutional law class. We met there, and our friendship soon ripened into love, then marriage in 1949 and a happily married life ever since. Our mutual interest in governmental affairs has continued all these years. For example, June and I helped found NT's student government. I was the first president, and she was a senator. Later on, during our 35-year diplomatic career, we both worked hard, leading to my being named U.S. ambassador to Belize. And even after retiring, we both regularly work on elections and other civic activities. Current-day students might also do well to study governmental affairs — even constitutional law!

I was on the bridge with Don, a fraternity brother, and his attractive friends whom I had not met. When we won, Don joyfully did a dive into the lake. He was hurt badly, and alarmed friends shouted that he was in trouble. I jumped in and carried him to the bank. Years later, talking with my wife about North Texas, I mentioned the rope pull. She knew about it because she had once gone with a friend and he had jumped off the bridge and hurt himself. It turned out that I had later met and married one of the beautiful girls who had been with Don on the bridge that day.

My roommate, Nick Cathcart (’05 M.B.A.), was dating her roommate, Morgan Emrich Dunbar (’03), and introduced us. I told Nick when we left that I was going to marry her. Of course he told her, and she thought I had been hit on the head too many times, I guess. I had to ask her out several times. Unfortunately being a part of the North Texas football team didn't carry much weight with her. She took some persuading but finally agreed. We dated a few years and have been married 10 this coming June. We had a lot of success in football, but she is by far the best thing I got in Denton.

He walked into what was then a TV room called the Lorena Lounge. When he smiled and said hello, the whole room lit up. He asked me out a couple weeks later. We got engaged on the fifth anniversary of that same day. We went back to reminisce and he proposed to me in that same room. We got married on that same day one year later at the Little Chapel in the Woods at TWU. If someone had told me I would marry the guy who walked through the door that day, I would not have believed it. We will celebrate our 15th anniversary this year. I’m so thankful for all the great times I had, all the lifelong friends I made, and most of all for the love of my life.

We got married in April 1989 and have two sons. Our older son is now a junior at UNT, and our younger son graduates from high school this year and hopes to attend UNT as well.

We then took the next course, ENGL 2220, together and started dancing at Bruce Hall's Friday night swing. I would say he was just my dance partner. He would say he always knew. I guess looking back, he was right. This August will be 13 years of marriage. We now have a beautiful daughter and are still dancing every chance we get.

A friend of a friend took me under her wing, and on my first day there, she introduced me to the coffee shop in the upstairs of the old Union Building. We sat with some of her friends who were members of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. I noticed one young man, Rick Fischer (’71, ’76 M.Ed.), and was told by my friend that under no circumstance should I even consider him as a possible date! So, of course, I ignored her advice and went with Rick to Bid Acceptance on Friday night. On Saturday I attended the football game with someone she considered a more appropriate date. No fireworks on that night at all. On Sunday, after a day at the lake, Rick and I got “dropped.” No one thought it would last. After all, we had only known each other a few days, and we had certainly rushed into a serious relationship. Well, it has been 46 years since we met and 44 years since we married. Three kids and four grandchildren later, I guess you could say there really is such a thing as love at first sight, and it really can last.

First, I met his brother, who was attending school after military service before he introduced me to my future husband, Clifford Kirkpatrick. He was working in West Texas while earning a geological engineering degree from the University of Oklahoma, and he came home to Denton as often as possible. It took only a few months until we married at the Little Chapel in the Woods on the Texas Woman’s University campus and then had our reception at Mary Arden Lodge. Pat Boone sang at our wedding — “Because" and "I Love You Truly,” and they truly were meaningful in our lives. This was April 1954, and I still had work to do before graduating. I received my Bachelor of Science and Master of Education at UNT. My special love passed from this life almost 10 years ago, and I still miss him. North Texas was a very important part of my life and, in fact, determined my life. We had one daughter, Starla. Oh, yes, and my love had a special birthday: Feb. 14. How great is that?

Later she dated one of my fraternity brothers. When they broke up, I zeroed in. Being an ex-athlete, I knew how to be aggressive and charming, and she thought I was so mature! In six months we were married on Thanksgiving evening, Nov. 22, 1962. After a nice church wedding in Dallas, we planned to have a honeymoon in Carlsbad Cavern. We only made it to Mineral Wells, where we stayed at the Baker Hotel for three days. We had to be back at class on Monday morning. This year for our 50th anniversary, we made it to Carlsbad. It has been a good 50 years. We both finished our bachelor’s degrees in 1964, then received our Master of Science degrees in 1968. I went on to become a superintendent of schools after many college hours at Texas A&M and the University of Texas at Arlington. My wife received her special education certification from Texas Woman’s University. We have two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Life has been good.

Dating followed! We were in the same economics class and that was fun. We appreciated each other so we spent time just talking. He re-enrolled at North Texas soon after his discharge from the Air Force. His seriousness about life and education appealed to me: I have some of his poetry. We shared similar values, so a love and respect followed. Many of our college days were centered on my sorority, Kappa Theta Pi, and his fraternity, Pi Phi Pi. Academics received priority, but formal and informal activities were really special. Friendships of more than 60 years are still a part of my life. Mr. Starr was a part of campus life. He was the policeman and had a direct line to the Dean of Women and to the Dean of Men. Proper behavior was expected at all times. Claude and I were married in March 1947 at the Little Chapel in the Woods. Our marriage produced two sons, very satisfying careers in the field of education, and an enriched life for well over 50 years. Claude died Sept. 12, 2001. Our children and grandchildren have been a blessing on a daily basis. Thank you, North Texas, for providing a framework for a successful life. Jean Marie Derrick Hoffman ('47, '57 M.B.E.)

Ethan sat next to me and we immediately struck up a conversation. Throughout the semester we studied together, ate lunch after class, and visited Rick's on the weekends. The following semester we took ENGL 2220 World Literature again taught by Dr. Julian Long. It was also during that time that we began dancing together at the weekly Friday night dances sponsored by the Social Dance Liberation Front held in the Bruce Hall Concert Hall. Although our different majors placed us in separate classes, we continued to dance together several nights per week. By September of 1999 we were engaged, and married in August 2000. I graduated in December of 2000 and Ethan graduated the following year, 2001. We have revisited the campus of North Texas several times and enjoy seeing how much the campus has grown. We always make sure to return to the GAB and see the classroom we first met in. Even after 11 years together we still continue to dance (though not as much). We are expecting our fist child in June of 2012. We hope to share our love of dancing and of course the University of North Texas.

He was president of Inter-Fraternity Council and she was president of Women’s Forum. She was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha and he was a Theta Chi. She first spotted him at an inter-fraternity football game where he was wearing a torn T-shirt that exposed his very muscular chest. When one of her sorority sisters said that he wanted to go out with her, she immediately said, “Yes!” Their favorite activity was dancing the North Texas “Push” in the UB to the fabulous music of the Lab Band directed by ’Fessor Graham. They were pinned later that year. (She lost the pin!) Kay remembers George’s father asking him at the end of one semester why the only “A” he made was in his golf class. (He still enjoys the game!) Both graduated in 1959 and were married after George completed his Air National Guard training in 1960. In 2010, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a big celebration in Houston where they have lived the entire 50 years. Their son, Collin, lives in Seattle with his wife, Stephanie, and daughter, Shannon. George, a B.B.A. grad, spent his 40-year career as an executive in the oil and gas industry, retiring from Tidewater in 2000. Kay graduated with a B.A. in fashion design and illustration. She worked for 20 years designing ready-to wear first and later creating costumes for the Houston Oilers Cheerleaders, the Astrodome, Astroworld, Houston Rockets Flight Crew and Houston Grand Opera. (George and Collin thought Kay’s job designing for the cheerleaders was the best job she ever had!) She is ending her 50-year career Aug. 31 at Houston Community College where after 30 years she is the division chair supervising instructional programs in fashion design, fashion merchandising, theatrical costume design, interior design, culinary/pastry arts, hotel/restaurant management and travel/tourism. George and Kay are both passionate about travel and have visited more than 50 countries where they purchased exotic masks for their 100+ piece collection. Their favorite journey was a photo-safari to Tanzania during the annual migration across the Serengeti of 300,000 wild African animals. Kay took more than 1,100 photos of thousands of zebras, wildebeasts, elephants, lions, leopards, cheetahs, rhinos, giraffes, baboons, crocodiles and a spectacular array of colorful birds. Masks and travel photo albums abound in the contemporary home they designed and built. For 50 years the Kings have sent an original custom-made holiday card to their friends and family. Because no one ever removes them from their mailing list, George and Kay now send out 1,000 cards each December. For several years now, Kay designed an ornament holiday greeting card that was fabricated in tin in Mexico. Several friends have commented that entire sections of their Christmas trees are covered with the Kings’ ornaments. Both George and Kay had planned to go to other schools, but they both changed to North Texas at the last minute. They are grateful for the excellent educations they got at North Texas, preparing them for long and successful careers. But they are even more grateful that they found each other there.

I was walking across campus with Paul Connor, who I had been dating. We came across a guy who Paul said was a new Pi Phi pledge. (Paul was president of Pi Phi Pi). Bob Henderson had on his Boy Scout uniform (for some pledge reason, which we laughed about). Paul graduated and took a job in South America. The following fall the first football game rolled around and I got a call at the sorority house from Bob asking me to go to the game with him, a little late. He was kind a gasping for breath and said he had just gotten back from Sherman, his home. I wanted to ask him if he ran all the way back, but I didn’t. I did tell him I would have to sit with the Green Jackets until the half. That was the beginning of a long and wonderful love affair. We loved to dance and never missed a Delta Chi or Pi Phi party. In our senior year I was named Pi Phi Sweetheart. What a thrill that was! We hung out at the Delta Chi house or the Pi Phi house, library or “The Corner.” On Sunday evenings we would ride “The Goose” (I wonder if they still call the bus the Goose?) to town and have dinner at a little Mom and Pop café just off the square. He would buy my dinner one week and I would buy his the next. It seemed like we were treating each other. (Money was very scarce.) After dinner we would go to a movie. We both had jobs in the Registrar’s Office and made 50 cents an hour. Another hangout was a small Mexican restaurant across the street from campus. They served hot apple pie with a piece of cheese on top. What a treat! We walked everywhere (no cars) in those days. If groups were walking they would be singing the N.T. Fight Song. I always thought North Texas had the greatest school spirit. We also went to ‘Fessor Graham’s lab band show on Saturday nights at the auditorium. They were a wonderful group of musicians. My Delta Chi roommate, Eva Farnsworth, said that I was seeing Bob quite often. I told her he was a lot of fun and a good dancer, but not the kind you marry. How little did I know. We graduated in June 1950 and married Aug. 26 (after we had secured jobs). Bob was in packaging with Pillsbury in Louisville, Ky., and then with Kaiser Aluminum in West Virginia and northern Indiana. I taught school for 33 years (math and computer science). We have two children and one grandchild. We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary in 2000 and soon after that moved to Bloomington, Ind., to be near our daughter. She thought that would be a great idea so that Bob and her husband could play golf and fish together. Unfortunately, that never happened. Three months after we moved, Bob had a massive coronary and was gone. It has been a lonely world without him, but I have great memories and they all began at UNT.

He was my blind date for a wedding reception. I said, “I like your name. I’m Nellie Taylor.” So, he replied, “I like yours.” That late afternoon we went to Nonie and Harley Redin’s wedding, and then to the reception on the rooftop of Flight 21 for an evening of dancing. We danced every dance. He made me smile. Just out of the Marines, Taylor drove to Denton to finish 6 hours that he needed to graduate. I started teaching in Gladewater. We saw each other on weekends going to Trojan dances and Kappa parties. We married in 1948, had two sons and spent our wonderful years together in El Paso, Waco, and ended up in Corsicana. Taylor was in a successful insurance business. He passed away in 2003. I am blessed with two handsome grandsons and now, two great-grandsons. They make me smile.

My attention was drawn to the entry way. There stood the most beautiful girl that I had ever seen. Believe me when I say that she was the most beautiful for I knew beauty when I saw it as I went to high school with a future Miss America a top new York model and a future Miss Teen USA. I remarked to my friend to look at those two girls who had just come in and one of our pledges asked if I wanted to meet them. It was part of pledge ship to get girls to sign your pledge book. This was a good way to get to know girls of course as well as introducing our pledges to the campus. The pledge proceeded to ask the girls if they needed a place to sit. As they came toward us I made sure that the beautiful brunette sat with me. We all introduced ourselves (Sherri Petitjean is her name and she was with her room mate and friend from high school, Judy Falconer). I was pretty tongue tied and attempted small talk. We agreed to go to bid acceptance that night for our first date. We dated for about a year until I asked her exactly one year to the date that we first met to get dropped. She said yes and I don't think that my feet felt earth for about 6 months. I was so in love with this beautiful shy girl. One year passed and at a spring reunion of our fraternity I asked her to get pinned ( engaged to be engaged). She accepted . A strange occurrance happened at a B. J. Thomas concert on campus in the old English building. Our song was his Hooked on a Feeling. Sherri and I got front row seats when B. J. came out and began talking to the audience. As guys are want to do I was slumped in my seat and B. J. asked me if there was anything wrong with me. I answered no and he said that he would dedicate the first song to Sherri and I. You guessed it , he sang Hooked on a Feeling, our song. Wow what a thrilling experience. It was like he knew that this was our song. Sherri and I got married in the fall of 1970 and we just celebrated 40 years of marriage. I might add that Sherri was crowned the first Queen of the school of business and her picture is in the 1970 annual. She was also asked to be in a calendar of the 12 most beautiful women on the UNT campus. We are about to celebrate 41 wonderful years of marriage. I often wonder how my life would have been different had I not looked to the entry way of the Student Union Building that day in November 19, 1968.

We were married in 1950 after we both graduated from UNT, and we spent the next 60 years together. She passed away on February 9 of this year and I miss her terribly. She was still beautiful at 88 years and 3 days. Her name was Evelyn Smyth when I met her in biology class, but it was Evelyn Vagt for the next 60 years. We spent our years together at various places in Texas -- she taught first grade and I was librarian at several different colleges in Big Spring, Odessa, Wichita Falls and, finally, Fort Worth. Our memories of UNT people and events are many and pleasant. One of her favorites was Demo School director Rose Baily. Those high on my list were Lady Kate Medders and Dr. Arthur Samply, both of the library school. Dr. George Morey and his dear wife lived next door to us on Chestnut Street in Denton.

Flowers and Marguerite Bentley Alton R. Flowers, of Denton, and Marguerite Bentley, from Fort Worth, met while enrolled as fellow students at North Texas in 1920. Alton was a freshman in 1919, and Marguerite entered in the fall of 1920. Marguerite resided at the Caskey House, 1316 West Oak St. They were introduced by Oa P. Grandey, a friend of Alton's, who later owned the Shaw Studio in Denton for many years. Dating in those days was spent in strolls around the campus, attending football games, and other campus events, as transportation and entertainment facilities were limited. Clothing for dates was quite dressy, with both Alton and Marguerite wearing hats for even casual events. That was the beginning of their courtship and marriage of almost 44 years, until Alton's death in 1969 and Marguerite's in 1972. Alton started his life-long career in accounting at Breckenridge, and Marguerite taught at Joshua and Westbrook before their marriage November 17, 1925. Four children were born to this union: a son, Alton Oa, and three daughters, Helen Louise, Margaret Jane and Alta Marie. The family lived in Fort Worth, Birdville and Colleyville until 1942, when Alton became an accountant with the W.T. Waggoner Estate, Wilbarger County; and the family moved to Vernon. Alton retired in 1963 but continued his public accounting practice, which helped send the four children through North Texas with degrees, a goal for which Alton and Marguerite were justifiably pleased. Two of their children, Oa and Alta, chose accounting as their careers, while Helen and Jane followed their mother in the teaching profession. Other descendants have graduated from UNT with advanced degrees. In 1985, a grandson-in-law earned his Ph.D. in psychology and has a private practice in Waco. Then, in spring 2010, a great-granddaughter received her master's degree in art history and is now employed with the Museum of Modern Art in Fort Worth. -- The Flowers family Comment #46 posted by Helen Flowers Pigg ('50, '52 M.Ed.)

He walked in and sat down next to me, as I secretly hoped he would. I tutored him in sign language and we became friends. After a few months of hanging out I decided to nervously get up the courage to ask him “do you think maybe we should date or something, sometime, huh?” To which he replied, “Um, ok!” One week later I went to his cousins wedding and met his entire family! After Graduation, we decided to move to Dallas. He moved into his own place and I moved in with my sister. In 2006 we moved in together and last February we bought our first house. We got engaged last September on the porch swing he bought me that I wanted so badly for my birthday. We are currently planning our wedding in Dallas for September 24, 2011.

He was working on his Ph.D. in information Technology and I was working on my Speech and Hearing Sciences Degree. He was teaching my Business Statistics class. Of course because he was my teacher and I was a student neither one of us said a thing. 2 years later, I was working in the Department of Accounting as an assistant. Randy came to teach a few classes in the Accounting Department before he graduated and to decide where he wanted to take a job. I figured maybe this was a "sign". I sent him an email and then had it taken back-I was chicken. So my friend/coworker went to his office and asked him if he was seeing anyone and told him she knew someone who was interested. He came to my office later that day and asked me out. We went on a lunch date September 26, 2007 and have been together ever since.
