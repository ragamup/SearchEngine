Having worked in academia for past 17 years, I am passionate about higher education and I look forward to contributing to the already rigorous, engaging and highly rated programs of the College of Information. Before joining COI, I served as an Associate Dean at Athabasca University located in Alberta, Canada, where I helped lead the Faculty of Science and Technology. Prior to that role, I served as Director in the School of Computing and Information Systems.   Assuming my role with UNT and COI, it is my desire to enhance collaboration with alumni, not only to keep each of you updated, but more importantly, to learn from your perspective, as I realize that you have experienced the College far more than myself. What might be the best mode of communication for you to continue the interaction? Please let me know by visiting http://coi.unt.edu/update-us.   Thank you for the opportunity to serve, and please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions, concerns, or ideas you would like to share. I look forward to personally visiting with many of you in the months ahead.   Sincerely,      Dr. Kinshuk      Dean – College of Information      Ofc: 1-940-565-2731      Email: ci-dean@unt.edu   The following are a series of questions that I personally would like to hear your input on.
