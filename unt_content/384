But that's the end game. The foundation for victory is laid long before any of our student-athletes compete for the Mean Green. Champions are built when passionate alumni, fans and friends give to help ensure our students have the resources and facilities they need to compete at the highest level. An investment in UNT Athletics strengthens our ability to make progress as champions in competition, in the classroom and in the community. Support for Mean Green Athletics helps our students achieve academic and athletic excellence, while elevating UNT’s profile as the institution offering a green light to greatness for our students on and off the field. Learn more about giving opportunities that help UNT Athletics build champions in the classroom and on the field.
