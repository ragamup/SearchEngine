Accuplacer tests are administered on a walk-in basis, Mon-Fri between 8:30 am - 3:00 pm, in the Mathematics Undergraduate Advising and Testing Center (GAB 443), and also at prescheduled orientation sessions. There is no charge for the Accuplacer test. What is the Placement Test? The UNT Department of Mathematics wants students to succeed and understands that students do best when they have a suitable background for each course. The purpose of the math placement test is to determine the appropriate first math course for each undergraduate student. The Mathematics Department enforces prerequisites for mathematics courses; before enrolling in one of these courses, you may need to pass a placement test. After a student has taken the placement test and placed into a particular course, the student must successfully complete that course within one year of the test date. If the student doesn't complete the course within one year of the test date, the student must take a new placement test.
