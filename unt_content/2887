The student-led restaurant opens to the public for the spring 2017 season on Feb. 20. The Club, open for seating from 11 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, serves a gourmet three-course meal. The lunch-themed dining facility is run by students in the UNT Hospitality Management program in the College of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism. Students in the program are enrolled in Restaurant Operations I and II and oversee all aspects of the dining experience from marketing and staff management to meal preparation and serving. Christa Cartwright, a senior in the Hospitality Management program, says she has plans to pursue a culinary degree after receiving her bachelors from UNT. “This program has exposed us to so much of the day-to-day restaurant operations,” said Cartwright. “We’re hosting, prepping veggies, preparing fresh homemade rolls and serving every day. You have the opportunity to work at every station and you get experience in every department.” The Club at Gateway will be open until April 28 during weekdays. Seating is available from 11 a.m. to noon. To view the menu or make a reservation, please visit https://htm.unt.edu/content/club.
