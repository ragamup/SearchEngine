BASIC MAP OF BUILDING DEPARTMENTS AND PARKING AND BUS STOP Discovery Park Dedicated to promoting a climate of research, UNT's nearly 300-acre Discovery Park (DP) campus, located approximately 5 miles north of the main Denton campus, is home to the College of Information. Originally a Texas Instruments plant, the facility has been retrofitted to house not only COI, but also the College of Engineering, UNT's Information Technology Shared Services, some business start-ups, and UNT's Office of Research and Economic Development.   The Center for Student Affairs has a strong presence at Discovery Park and often hosts special events, such as bar-b-ques, talks, and visits by UNT's President and others. Discovery Park also has its own library, dedicated to serving the information needs of students within the Colleges of Information and Engineering.   Additional useful information about Discovery Park includes: Bus service between UNT's main campus and DP Parking regulations and parking map at DP Meals @ DP:                                              By entrance to Park Place Market                            Room G110 Contact Us For additional information about student resources within the College of Information, contact our Academic Advising Office at ci-advising@unt.edu or 940-565-3562.
