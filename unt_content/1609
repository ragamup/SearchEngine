We study people—how children and adults learn, how teachers teach, how educational leaders lead, how to evaluate and improve programs, how to counsel those in need, how to serve our schools and communities, how to promote well-being. We serve the public by helping them live happier, healthier, and more productive lives. In the classroom, at the campus leadership and the superintendent levels, graduates of the UNT College of Education have provided outstanding innovative leadership to the children of Texas and their communities and have distinguished themselves in their practice and profession."Dr. Stephen F. WaddellSuperintendent, Lewisville Independent School District The University of North Texas (UNT) College of Education is regionally and nationally recognized for excellence in preparing leaders in the human service and educational spheres of public, private and corporate institutions. We achieve this through promoting faculty and student research, designing learner-centered instruction, developing collaborative partnerships and disseminating the results of these efforts. The College of Education supports and leads the University's Equity and Diversity Initiative to create an inclusive environment where all members of our community value, support, and respect each other and the educational benefits of diversity. Faculty, staff and students are committed to inquiry and shared discovery, best professional practices, active participation in professional and scholarly organizations, effective use of technology, and the value of intellectual and human diversity. College faculty contribute to achieving the mission by expanding knowledge through research, publication and service. The College of Education's Field Experience Program for new Texas teachers provides student teaching interns with extensive opportunities to move beyond being students of organized knowledge to become classroom teachers who put their acquired knowledge into practice in the classroom.
