The Wind Studies area offers performance opportunities for students in nine ensembles including the Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, Brass Band, Concert Band, University Band, Green Brigade Marching Band, and other athletic bands. The graduate conducting program in the Wind Studies Area offers degrees at both the Masters and Doctoral level. The goal of the program is to develop conductors for professional careers in performance and education through intensive study of literature and pedagogy as well as the summer Conductor’s Collegium, a multifaceted workshop which provides opportunities for instrumental music educators of all levels from around the world to meet and discuss common goals, shared concerns, and practical solutions with colleagues and performers. The rigorous and varied curriculum prepares well-rounded conductors for successful professional careers in our field. Graduate Conducting Associates receive practical experience working regularly with the various ensembles, appearing regularly on concert programs throughout the year. Additionally, Conducting Associates are integrally involved in the administrative aspect of the Wind Studies area.
