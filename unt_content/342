That impact can come from multiple activities including building start-up companies, training leaders for science and engineering growth, publication of fundamental research, licensing technology that creates products and services, and providing services to different communities that serve needs unmet or otherwise lacking throughout our world. With growth of research at UNT, Technology Transfer and Economic Development is growing its leadership to help our faculty expand the impact of their research.

Technology Transfer The two core functions of Technology Transfer is the protection and commercialization of Intellectual Property developed by UNT. To that end, UNT’s Technology Transfer function provides several core activities: Manage disclosure of new inventions and creative works by faculty and staff Protection of disclosed inventions and creative works Reporting and compliance related to Intellectual Property Commercialization of Intellectual Property Negotiation of Sponsored Research Projects with corporate partners and collaborators Assistance with Intellectual Property issues and projects on campus Material Transfer Agreements and Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements Economic Development Economic Development at UNT utilizes Technology Transfer to increase innovation on campus and the impact innovation has on UNT’s communities. Usually, Economic Development is considered a larger engagement than a traditional Technology Transfer transaction. For example, Economic Development works with companies and the local government to help spur innovation in the local business sectors. This includes developing public and private partnerships including research space and the incubation of companies. As UNT grows in its research capacity and prowess, Economic Development serves the needs of faculty who have larger-impact programs and companies who seek fruitful relationships with our researchers and students.
