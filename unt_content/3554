The IIG recommends strategies to academic affairs and the university at-large that aid in setting, refining, and achieving UNT’s goals in India and that contribute to UNT attaining Tier One status. The philosophy of the IIG is to enhance UNT’s successful engagements and visibility and India beyond individual UNT faculty/staff relationships. The IIG identified four thrust areas for furthering UNT’s engagements in India, including: Student Engagement (Ila Manuj) Research Engagement (STEM – Raj Banerjee, Humanities/Social Sciences – Pankaj Jain) Local Community Engagement – (Niranjan Tripathy) Marketing (Pankaj Jain) Please direct any inquiries about the IIG or requests to join the UNT-India listserv to Amanda.White@unt.edu.   India Initiatives Meeting Minutes India Initiatives Members India Venture Fund International Student Organizations   Visit Us Marquis Hall 1511 West Mulberry Street Marquis Hall, Room 105 Denton, TX 76201 Mail Us University of North Texas 1155 Union Circle, #311067 Denton, TX 76203-5017 USA Contact Us 940-565-2197 amanda.guccione@unt.edu Technical issues?
