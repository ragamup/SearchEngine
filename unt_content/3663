Experienced writers have an arsenal of reference materials that help them correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, style, citations, and format. It may take you some time to amass your own reference library, and you may find that you need to update it periodically. We recommend the following: A writing handbook like Diana Hacker's A Writer's Reference (ISBN-13: 978-1457686498) A dictionary like the American Heritage Dictionary (ISBN-13: 978-0553583229) A style guide for your major (compiled by the UNT Library) Citation Generators and Research Management Tools (compiled by the UNT Library) You can also download our Writing Lab handouts: Active vs. Passive Voice Agreement APA Style Basic Formats--Brochure Basic Formats--Letter Basic Formats--Memo Chicago Manual of Style College Writing--Formulating an Arguable Thesis College Writing--Supporting Your Thesis College Writing--Writing the Conclusion Commas Document Design Freshman Composition: English 1310 & 1320 Getting Started: Facing the Blank Page Grammar--Parts of Speech Grammar--Modifiers Literary Analysis MLA Style Nouns--Countable & Uncountable Parallel Structure Personal Statements Proofreading Like a Pro Proposals Punctuation Quotations Research Basics Science Writing Technical Writing Style Usage: Common Errors Thinking about UNT?
