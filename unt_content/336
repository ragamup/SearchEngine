The Conflict of Interest Review Committee, composed of five faculty members, determines whether a researcher's Significant Financial Interest could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research activities funded or proposed for such funding, and determines what conditions or restrictions, if any, should be imposed to manage such interests. The Committee will take such actions as are necessary to ensure that reported Significant Financial Interests are managed, reduced, or eliminated in accordance with federal regulations. Any conditions or restrictions to resolve or manage conflicts of interest must be implemented before the expenditure of any funds awarded under a grant or contract. Examples of conditions or restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest include: public disclosure of Significant Financial Interests; monitoring of the research by independent reviewers;  modification of the research plan; and  disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the research project in question. Active researchers with external funding or researchers applying for external funding are required to submit Significant Financial Interest disclosures forms, whether or not there are any Significant Financial Interests to disclose. Please see the links below for instructions on completing the disclosure form and to access the form for the current academic year.
