FAQ: GRADING FOR UNT MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT The UNT Department of Mathematics is pleased to provide student academic positions that assist students with their expenses. As campus awareness of these positions has increased, so has the volume of applications. Remember that there is a priority system for filling student academic positions (as listed on the application): undergraduate math majors have priority over math minors who have priority over students whose major or minor is something other than mathematics. It is essential that you carefully read the following information. This is a lengthy transmission, but your understanding of the information is critical to a successful and quick semester start-up. Graders must be detail-oriented, and you are expected to understand the compensation formulas and to pay particular attention to correct and timely completion of your timesheets. 1. Semester wage and hours per week: Funding for graders is provided through a program fee paid by students. A formula involving the number of students enrolled in the class you are grading for is used to estimate the number of hours you will work per week. Again, this is just an estimate, and not to be expected each grading assignment. Some grading assignments will take less time and will be reflected on your timesheet. 3. International students: Remember that the total number of hours per week that you may work is 20, which includes Math Lab, other jobs on or off campus, etc. It is your responsibility to monitor the total number and decline any job offer that would extend your work past 20 hours a week. 4. Necessary documentation for payroll: If you are a NEW employee to UNT, you will be required to complete the on-boarding process with the Mathematics department. On-boarding is a two-step process of entering required payroll information online then providing two forms of identification to Jana Watkins in GAB 435. Original forms of identification that are accepted are: Driver's License, Birth Certificate, Social Security Card (cannot be laminated or altered in anyway) or Passport. The on-boarding process MUST be complete before your first day of employment with the department. 5. Meeting for Graders: Each semester there will be a mandatory meeting for all graders with grading assignments that semester. Meeting dates and times will be emailed out to all graders at least 3 days before the meeting dates. Students who do not attend the pre-semester meeting will not be eligible to work that semester as a grader. 6. Grading Assignment(s): Will be emailed out when final assignments have been made each semester. It will be the graders responsibility to contact the Instructor of the assigned class to set up a meeting with them. The instructors email will be provided to you in the assignment email. 7. Evaluation of Performance: The Grader Evaluation Form is found on the upper left hand side of this web page. Please read it as soon as you complete reading this document. It will give you a better understanding of what is expected of a grader for the Department of Mathematics. The instructor-completed evaluation is the basis of your continued employment from semester to semester. i) A good grader is both accurate and prompt; nothing less is acceptable. ii) Please note that failure to meet these standards (Accuracy and Promptness) is grounds for immediate termination and replacement. 8. Textbooks: Textbooks may be checked out with Carol Fischer, Textbook Coordinator, located in GAB 431. 9. Secured Mailbox: Each grader will have a box in the secured mailroom, to which access is granted by key pad code. Your instructor may prefer that you use his/her box in the main office, GAB 435, as a drop-off (during normal business hours); that will be established in your initial meeting with your instructor. 10. Communication: We communicate with graders primarily via email, and we are required to correspond with them only via their UNT email address. Graders are required to keep their electronic mailbox available to receive mail from the instructor to whom they are assigned and from the Math Lab. CONTINUING EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA 1. Academic Qualifications: ~ Hourly Academic Assistants must be currently enrolled as a student as a condition of employment. Academic Assistants must be in good standing and making satisfactory progress towards their degree. "Good Standing" is defined as not being on academic probation. ~ Failure to meet the enrollment requirement as set forth above will be grounds for withdrawal of a student's service appointment and termination of employment status. 2. Reappointment: Reappointment of hourly Student Academic Assistants is made in accordance with the instructional needs of the department. A student may be considered for reappointment if he/she: ~ has provided satisfactory prior service and, ~ is in good academic standing and making satisfactory progress towards a degree, as defined in the graduate and undergraduate catalogs.
