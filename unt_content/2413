Becoming a vendor with UNT UNT Dining Services is the largest university food service provider in North Texas. With 21 Retail Food Shops, 5 Cafeterias, a full-service restaurant, and a catering department, we serve well over 2.2 million meals every year to around 37,000 students. Part of what makes us successful is our partnerships with community entrepreneurs and sub-contractors who share our passion for serving our students a variety of great food in different service platforms like food trucks or our own food court. If you are a vendor who would like to be a part of our food service operation please follow the steps below: Send your proposal to Kim.Schroeder@UNT.edu. Proposal should include at minimum: a summary of your concept and food service experience; your menu with prices; and photos of the inside and outside of your current or previous operation. Once these items are received your concept will be presented to the executive team for consideration and you will be contacted with a yes or no response. If you are accepted as a possible vendor you will be contacted by a one of our directors to discuss next steps. If you are a food truck vendor and are invited to be part of our campus food service operation we will ask you to come to campus for an inspection of your truck by our health and fire departments. Once all inspections are complete a contract will be negotiated between you and the University and a location for your food truck will be located. Once all of the above steps are complete you will be in business. If you have any questions please contact our Retail Director, Kim Schroeder, at Kim.Schroeder@unt.edu, or call 940-369-7171.
