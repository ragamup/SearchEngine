Short-term loans are intended to help eligible students with temporary cash flow problems pay the amount due for their *current* tuition and fees (it is not available for any past due balances). The loans are awarded for the minimum amount of tuition and fees each semester. The loans are posted to the student account in order to make the first payment in the fall or spring or the entire payment in a summer semester. How to Get a Short-Term Loan Students must meet the following criteria in order to qualify for a loan: No outstanding blocks (Service Indicators preventing the student from receiving a Short-Term Loan). No outstanding loans (Service Indicator showing loan default status). Students who have previously defaulted on a short-term loan that has been sent to a collection agency are not eligible to receive short-term loans. Students can get short-term loans online through their MyUNT portal by following these steps: Log on to my.unt.edu using your EUID and password. On the left-hand side menu, click on "Finances" Click on“Make A Payment” Click on the “Short Term Loan” tab. Read carefully, then click “Continue Processing Loan.” Read the terms of the loan carefully and print them if you like, then click the check box stating “I accept the terms of the Short Term Loan & Installment Plan.” To finalize, click “Accept Terms and Proceed with Loan” and you will be taken to a screen stating the amount of your short-term loan. If you wish to see your new payment schedule, click the “Account Inquiry” tab at the top. Then, click the “Charges Due” tab to review your due dates and print or record them for reference. Repayment Arrangements Students will automatically be placed on the UNT Installment Plan when obtaining a short-term loan for the fall or spring semesters. Short-term loans can be issued to pay the first installment amount if a student's anticipated aid is not enough to cover the first installment amount. A one-time 1% origination fee will be charged at the time of the loan in addition to the $20.00 charge for being placed on the installment plan. All loans must be repaid by the established due date in order to avoid collection costs. Unpaid loans are subject to being submitted to an outside collection agency. The following fees are not covered by a short-term loan and must be paid before a short-term loan is awarded: Property Deposit, Late Registration Fee, Sponsored student fees, THEA fee, Credit by exam fee and Miscellaneous Fees (parking, health center, new student orientation fee).
