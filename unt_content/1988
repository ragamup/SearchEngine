The Registrar’s Office will post course duplications at the request of the student, at the request of an academic advisor or upon review of the student’s record. Until a duplication is posted the Registrar’s Office includes a repeated course in the student’s cumulative record of hours attempted and grade points earned. The Registrar includes without exception any course repeated more than once in the student’s cumulative record or hours attempted and grade points earned. Departments may count the highest grade for departmental GPA requirements; however, the academic dean uses only the last grade recorded in certifying the student’s eligibility for graduation. Status Changes Due to Course Duplications A student request for a recording of a course duplication made before or on the last class day of any term or session will be reflected in the hours attempted and grade points earned at the beginning of the term/semester or session. If a student who is on academic alert or probation requests the recording of a course duplication, and the resulting adjusted CGPA equals or exceeds the minimum 2.0 academic standard, the academic alert or probation status will be removed if the student notifies the Registrar’s Office on or before the last class day for that term/semester or session. Otherwise, the student will remain on academic alert or probation for that enrollment period and be subject to attendant penalties. If a student is suspended at the end of a term/semester during which the student has repeated a course and the posting of that duplication will result in a CGPA that would have been sufficient to be continued on probation at the end of that term/semester during which the student has repeated a course and the posting of that duplication will result in a CGPA that would have been sufficient to be continued on probation at the end of that term/semester (or be cleared), the student will be reinstated if the student requests the duplication and applies for reinstatement at the Registrar’s Office. The delayed posting of course duplications completed during prior enrollment periods cannot be used as a basis for altering suspension history or reinstating lost registration schedules. Courses duplicated Fall 2005 and later will result in a re-evaluation of a student's suspension history beginning with the term that the duplication was completed. The delayed processing of course duplications and updating of suspension history cannot be used as justification for reinstating lost registration schedules. Repeated Course Tuition - Undergraduate Students Only Repeated Course Tuition Undergraduate students classified as Texas residents or who pay Texas resident tuition rate who attempt certain courses more than twice at the University of North Texas are subject to an additional tuition rate of $75.00 per semester credit hour for the repeated course. This additional charge will be billed after the beginning of each semester. Repeated Hours for Taken Course Repeated hours are defined as hours for a course that is the same or substantially similar to a course that the student has previously taken for two or more times at the same institution.  Previously taken courses from which the student withdraws before the official census date shall not count as an attempted course. Exempted Courses Courses that are exempted from Repeated Course Tuition include: Hours for special topics and seminar classes; Hours for courses that involve different or more advanced content each time they are taken, including but not limited to: - individual music lessons - theater practicum - music performance - ensembles - studio art Viewing Repeated Courses Students can view their repeated courses affecting tuition on the For Students page at my.unt.edu.
