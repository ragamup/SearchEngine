Home At the University of North Texas, we have many staff and faculty advisors who can help you plan for your major requirements, and degree planning. Depending on your major and/or minor you might have more than one academic advising office you might need to visit throughout your academic career. Your academic advising office is the place to go for assistance in understanding and making connections between your personal goals and your educational career. Academic advising is a collaborative educational process in which you are an active participant. You and your advisor are partners in pursuing your academic success. To find your academic advisor, contact your department. UNT’s Colleges and Schools each have their own academic advising offices. After you have been accepted into your major and course of study, you will be working with the advisors in your chosen college. Some majors require fulfillment of preadmission requirements.
