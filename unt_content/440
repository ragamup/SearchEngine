The Code explains what conduct is prohibited, the process the DOS uses to review reports of alleged misconduct by students, and the sanctions that can be imposed. When students may have violated the Code they meet with a university official to discuss the alleged misconduct in an educational process. CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE CODE OF STUDENT CONDUCT CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RETAILIATION POLICY  Anyone can report alleged misconduct to the Dean of Students Office by calling 940.565.2648, emailing conduct.dos@unt.edu, or visiting DOS in the University Union, suite 409. Crimes can be reported to law enforcement (the UNT Police Department or the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over where the crime took place). Anyone who has experienced discrimination or harassment (including sex-based harassment such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct, relationship violence or stalking) can contact the DOS (940.565.2648), the Title IX Coordinator/Office of Equal Opportunity (940.565.2759), or the UNT Police Department (940.565.3000) to file a report.
