The sponsor workshop or grant-writing workshop that will be attended must be listed in the application.   Restrictions Funds must be expended within four (4) months of award. Funds from this grant may not be used for travel to workshops, conferences, or other sites such as those of collaborators or partners.  If attendance at workshops accompanies other travel, COI funds will only be considered for the incremental cost of the visit to the funding agency. Reimbursement will be based on actual expenses (up to the Government Services Administration per diem limit) and itemized receipts will be required.    Eligibility To be eligible for a COI Extramural Travel grant the faculty member must hold the academic rank of Assistant Professor or higher and be employed on a full-time basis in tenure/tenure track position.   Selection Criteria Priority will be given to requests that supplement funds from Department sources. Preference will be given to new faculty developing their research programs or faculty who are reinitiating or redirecting their research.   Deadline Applications for Extramural Travel grants may be made at any time during the year. The Dean’s Office will notify applicants within ten (10) business days after receipt.   Submission Fill in each section of the application, attach your Department Chair's signature of approval (and attesting to their financial support if applicable), and press submit.   Name * Email * Academic Title * Proposed use of funds * Detailed budget * Dates of Travel * Support Amount * $ Include the amount of Departmental Support.
