After reprising his acclaimed performance as the knight Ubaldo in Haydn’s Armida at the 2009 Salzburg Festival, Richard Croft began the 2009 - 2010 season with his much-anticipated debut at La Scala in the title role ofIdomeneo under the baton of Myung-Whun Chung, in a production by Luc Bondy. He took on the role of Jupiter in a David McVicar production of Handel’s Semele at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, conducted by Christophe Rousset, and reprised Idomeneo as the centerpiece of the Mozarteum’s Mozartwoche in Salzburg. The American tenor also joined frequent collaborator Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre in a special concert for President Sarkozy and invited French dignitaries to celebrate the reopening of the newly refurbished Palace of Versailles. Richard Croft’s 2008 - 2009 season included Idomeneo with René Jacobs and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra (also recorded and released on Harmonia Mundi in May 2009 to rave reviews); a European tour and recording (to be released on Harmonia Mundi in autumn 2009) with Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre, featuring musical odes to Saint Cecilia by Purcell, Haydn, and Handel, a staged version of Handel’s Messiah for the Theater an der Wien; and Idomeneo at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, under the baton of Mo. Minkowski. During the 2007 - 2008 season, Mr. Croft made a triumphant return to the Metropolitan Opera as M.K.
