The second location will serve the growing number of students seeking financial assistance. The Student Money Management Center is located in Chestnut Room 313 and offers personal financial coaching, tuition and housing payment planning, job offers and benefit package analysis, graduation transition financial planning and emergency loan program services to students. Danielle Champagne, assistant director of coaching, emergency loans and assessment for the Student Money Management Center, was tasked with staffing the new office. “The physical location has an added benefit due to the high level of referrals already made between the Student Money Management Center, Student Accounting and Financial Aid,” she says. Champagne added that the ESSC was chosen as the location for the new office because of its central location on campus, noting that the office will “hopefully help motivate students to take advantage of a convenient location for financial services.” “The new office represents a new era for the SMMC – two offices, one mission,” Champagne says. “We are ready to help students achieve their financial success.”   Top Required Links Apply now Schedule a tour Get more info Main Menu Home Admissions Academics Student Life About UNT Research Athletics Giving University Links MyUNT EagleConnect Blackboard People & Departments Calendar UNT Map Jobs at UNT Colleges & Schools Specifically for Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Parents & Family Community Emails Graduate Admissions Freshman Admissions Transfer Admissions International Admissions     Find UNT on Google Maps 1155 Union Circle #311277 Denton, Texas 76203-5017   Visitor Information   940-565-2000   800-RELAY TX   Technical Issues Call us Email Us UNT Map Disclaimer | AA/EOE/ADA | Privacy | Electronic Accessibility | Required Links ©2017 University of North Texas
