Graduation is the process of being awarded a degree after completion of credit hours and other degree requirements. Actual diplomas are not awarded at commencement ceremonies and participation in the ceremonies is not a guarantee of degree completion.To officially graduate from UNT, a student must apply for graduation by the posted deadline. After receipt of final grades, the student's degree audit or degree plan must show the student satisfied all university, college and departmental requirements for the specific degree. A degree becomes official when it is posted to a student's transcript -- typically two to three weeks after the completion of their final term -- not by their participation in commencement exercises.Please remember:Enrollment at a Second Institution: If you are currently enrolled at another institution, you cannot graduate from UNT this semester.You cannot graduate from a program that you have not been admitted to. If you do not have an option to select the program you are completing (for example, if you are completing an MS in Psychology but only have the option to select the PhD program you are in), please contact Toulouse Graduate School Admissions (graduateschool@unt.edu) to complete the necessary application.
