Commuter Meal Plans For the longer version of this video with more details, click here. College life can be hectic. Commuting to campus, attending classes, studying for exams, and working your evening job doesn't leave you much time for a social life. Why spend your precious free time grocery shopping, slaving over a stove, or washing dishes when you could purchase a UNT Dining Services meal plan and have your fill of healthy, made-from-scratch food, without preparation or clean-up! Also, dining off campus can be very expensive and provide you with unhealthy eats that still leave you hungry.  You’ll want to take advantage of the tremendous savings, be nourished with our wholesome variety and prepare for the unexpected at any of our eleven award winning facilities. The food services staff will be here for you Monday through Sunday. Remember to choose a Commuter meal plan that best fits your lifestyle.  You’ll want to think about how much time you have and how important food is to you.  Take a look below to consider your options.   2017-2018 - Resident Meal Plans (available to Commuters as well) The price breakdown below accounts for one semester.   Meals/Semester Price/Meal Flex $ Base Tax Total Savings Eagle Basic Unlimited Sun - Sat $2.97 $240 $1,630 $134.48 $1,764.48 62% Eagle Value Unlimited Sun - Sat $2.85 $400 $1,735 $143.14 $1,878.14 63% Eagle Super Flex Unlimited Sun - Sat $2.70 $600 $1,865 $153.86 $2,018.86 65%                 Scrappy Basic Unlimited  Mon - Fri $4.07 $90 $1,475 $121.69 $1,596.69 47% Scrappy Value Unlimited  Mon - Fri $3.99 $225 $1,580 $130.35 $1,710.35 49% Scrappy Super Flex Unlimited Mon - Fri $3.78 $525 $1810 $149.33 $1,959.33 51%     Commuters General Information Door Price for Fall 2017-Spring 2018: Bruce, Kerr, Champs and Maple Dining Halls are $7.75 per entry:  Breakfast - Lunch - Dinner Students living off campus or in fraternity/sorority houses may choose to purchase any Voluntary Meal Plan or any Resident Meal Plan.
