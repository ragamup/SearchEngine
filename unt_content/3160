QUOTES about LYNN SEATON Lynn Seaton has "a spirit of bold experimentation while still embracing the Old School". - Bill Milkowski, Jazz Critic "Seaton lays down an imposing walking groove…and demonstrates sublime lyricism." - Bass Player Magazine "Seaton is a bass player with a technique beyond imagining – his hand slides up and down the neck of the bass with the speed of the darting tongue of a cobra, his fingers dance on the strings ala Fred Astaire, and the notes come bursting forth." - Sid Weinberg, Blue Notes Jazz Letter Milt Hinton’s Five Favorite Bassists… “Ray Brown, Ron Carter, Rufus Reid,Lynn Seaton, and Christian McBride". - New York Times “Lynn is an excellent player, inspiring clinician, outstanding teacher and one of the finest musicians presently preserving the music through education.” -Jamey Aebersold “An imaginative and deft soloist, he draws a remarkable wealth of sonorities from his instrument. Seaton is particularly fond of playing with the bow, which he masters with great virtuosity. Regardless of the tempo, his music radiates exquisite swing.” - Aleardo Buzzi, Claves Jazz “One of the best clinicians I’ve seen is Lynn Seaton.” - Jiggs Wigham “Lynn Seaton is an outstanding musician who has provided our students with meaningful instruction during our jazz residency.” - Rob Ratner, Director of Performing and Fine Arts, Mineola, NY Schools “His sound is like that of the fine orchestral bassist, for he has developed his Arco technique to the level of his formidable pizzicato…Lynn Seaton has effectively established his own voice in current jazz music.” - Matthew Hughes, International Society of Bassists Magazine Visit Us Music Building 415 Avenue C Denton, TX 76201 Mail Us University of North Texas 1155 Union Circle #311367 Denton, TX 76203-5017 Contact Us 940-565-2791 music.information@unt.edu Technical issues?
