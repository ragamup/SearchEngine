Our Story UNT Dining is the largest self-supported food service department in North Texas. With our 21 Retail Food Shops, 5 Cafeterias, a full-service restaurant, and a catering department, we serve over 2.2 million meals annually.  Our food service program is award winning and we have been nationally recognized by organizations like Food Service Director Magazine, Presidents Council for Responsible Medicine, and PETA. We are also the recipient of the prestigious Loyal E. Horton Award from the National Association of College and University Food Services.  We also take matters of waste and sustainability very seriously. We cook from scratch, which reduces packaging waste. We also generate an annual campaign to raise awareness of food waste in the cafeterias, which has significantly reduced the amount of food being thrown away every day. We’ve also eliminated trays from our cafeterias so we’ve cut down on our water use. We have a prime vendor, which increases efficiency and drastically reduces the amount of trucks making deliveries to campus. And, in contrast to food service contractors, UNT Dining is a truly local enterprise. Our entire staff lives in the area, we make sure our food sources are as local as possible, and our resources go right back into benefiting the UNT community. We don’t just serve UNT, we are UNT, and that affinity affects everything we do. To learn more about our commitment to sustainability, go here.  Follow Us Tweets by @UNTdining Like Us University of North Texas Dining © 2017 A Mopro Website Back to Top
