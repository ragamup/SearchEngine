Doctor of Philosophy in Special Education - Concentration in Autism Intervention The doctoral concentration in Autism Research and Leadership program focuses on the preparation of personnel to assume leadership roles in the area of autism research, education, and training.  In addition to the required course work, all doctoral students who are currently receiving federal funding are also required to accomplish a number of professional competencies including submitting a grant application for external funding, participating in mentored research prior to initiating their dissertation activities, submitting a manuscript for publication consideration, course instruction, presenting at national, state or regional conventions, and engaging in advocacy and volunteer activities involving students with autism or their support persons.  The requirements are designed to increase the capacity of graduates to provide effective leadership in the area of autism programming and policy development and to conduct valid, empirical intervention-based research that will bridge existing research-to-practice gaps and improve outcomes for students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and their families.
