In order to speed up and make more accurate proposal submissions, UNT has secured and customized electronic proposal administration software called "Cayuse" from the provider Evisions. Cayuse Sponsored Projects (Cayuse SP) facilitates internal electronic routing of all sponsored project proposals. Cayuse SP became available in the Fall of 2015. Cayuse SP electronic routing has replaced the previous paper and email routing process ( UNT Routing Form ). Cayuse SP is also designed to assist the Office of Grants & Contracts Administration (OGCA) with sponsored project awards management and provides a framework for Principal Investigators (PIs), departments, and colleges to track their sponsored program activities and produce reports.
