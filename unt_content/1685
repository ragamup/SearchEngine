(Taken from the website: http://www.abet.org) Accreditation is proof that a collegiate program has met certain standards necessary to produce graduates who are ready to enter their professions. Students who graduate from accredited programs have access to enhanced opportunities in areas such as employment, mobility, and providing a positive impact on society. ABET is an integral part of each of these areas because it accredits over 3,100 applied science, computing, engineering, and technology programs at more than 660 colleges and universities in 23 countries worldwide. Approximately 85,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year. Accreditation is an assurance that the professionals that serve us have a solid educational foundation and are capable of leading the way in innovation, emerging technologies, and in anticipating the welfare and safety needs of the public.
