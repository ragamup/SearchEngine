Purpose of RMS RMS provides proactive support for many areas critical to the strategic, operational and financial foundation of the university. Risk can arise from research, international initiatives or routine functions such as facilities maintenance. RMS helps identify, analyze and mitigate risks so that the university can freely pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Mitigation and Control Successful accomplishment of the University's strategic goals depends heavily on risk mitigation, whether through reduction and prevention of risks, or through implementing and enhancing controls. RMS offers the opportunity to more fully understand risks, and to recommend the optimum level of mitigation using loss categories such as, Property, Liability, Human Resources and Net Income. RMS Sections The RMS department is organized into four major sections to identify and address risks and apply control measures for any exposure in the categories of loss.
