The work of biologists is critical to: increasing our understanding of the natural world helping us understand and treat disease addressing environmental issues With a bachelor's degree in biology, you may qualify for a career in environmental management and conservation, industry (instrumentation or pharmaceutical sales, or laboratory technician), secondary school education or government. At the Department of Biological Sciences at UNT, we are constantly assessing our degree programs with an eye on their relevancy to today's marketplace. Research and Teaching Careers Researchers work for various government agencies, clinics and hospitals, and national, nonprofit and private laboratories. To be a professional researcher in biology and/or to teach at a university, you will need to earn a master's and possibly a doctoral degree. There are many interesting careers available to you if you want to combine an education in biology with your interest in another field, including: forensic biologists -- working with law enforcement agencies to help solve crimes by applying scientific methods to uncover evidence; cytotechnologists -- using microscopic interpretation of cells to detect diseases; medical technologists -- performing tests on body fluids using state-of-the-art medical equipment; biotechnologists -- helping develop and improve medical treatments and environmental products; biochemists -- conducting cell research in government agencies, clinics and hospitals, and nonprofit and private laboratories, or creating new and beneficial products for humanity and the environment such as medicine, agricultural chemicals, cosmetics, food and beverages, environmentally friendly cleaners and biodegradable plastics; business biologists -- working with chemical or pharmaceutical companies and other organizations to research and test new products. Healthcare Careers A major in biology can also prepare you to enter dental, medical or veterinary school or a training program to become a healthcare professional such as an optometrist or pharmacist. UNT has a full-time preprofessional advisor for students planning a career in health care. Biology and Biochemistry majors may combine college and medical school through a joint program between UNT and the UNT Health Science Center at Fort Worth. This program can save you money and time by allowing you to be ready to serve in a residency at a hospital or clinic in seven years instead of the usual eight years needed to complete a bachelor's degree and medical school. Career Advising & Exploration The department's full-time staff of professional advisors can answer your questions and help you stay on track for your career goals. UNT's Career Center has information about jobs and employers, and the staff can help you with resume and letter writing, job search strategies, and interview preparation. In addition, juniors and sophomores who have completed at least 15 hours of biology coursework are encouraged to enroll in BIOL 3030 Careers in the Life Sciences, which is offered during the Spring semester. This course includes information about careers choices, career preparation, survival skills, and how to become involved in research labs. Thinking about UNT? It's easy to apply online.
