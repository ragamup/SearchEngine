She states, "My purpose in life is to educate those who educate young children through play and literacy!" She has shared this purpose with children at a summer camp, early childhood classrooms, children’s bookstores, children’s museums, college/county libraries and a classroom in rural South Africa.Tiffany Durham Currently, Tiffany is an Early Literacy Consultant in San Antonio, Texas and is known as “Miss Tiffany” the Story time Chick because it is just too darn cute not to squawk like a chicken when you sing ‘If You Are Happy and You Know It’. Since her birthday is the same as Randolph Caldecott, she plans to dedicate her life to Children’s Literature and would love not only to be on the Caldecott Book Selection Committee someday but be the serve as committee chair. Tiffany has completed three semesters towards her Masters in Library and Information Science. She remarks, "My short term career goal is to work as a Children’s Librarian and long term goal is to work in Sub-Sahara Africa as a literacy consultant". Reading and writing difficulties came to light in the eighth grade for Tiffany who learned she was reading and spelling at a third grade level. Her parents located an Orton Gillingham tutor to assist with her dyslexia her freshman year.  "It was this tutor that introduced me to literature", recalls Tiffany. Her love for listening and dramatizing a story grew from one grandmother’s love of audio books and the others love to tell the story.  "The LIS online courses have been a wonderful experience for me as a learner," states Ms. Durham. "My journey to this point is a bit of a struggle but the lessons learned are so fulfilling. I can’t imagine that taking a simpler path would have made me into the person I am today. Receiving the College of Information Alumni Society Lady Kate Medders Scholarship is truly an honor!"
