From our founding in 1890 as a teachers college, we now certify over 1000 teachers annually and prepare many other professionals.  The College of Education has undergraduate and graduate programs that prepare: Elementary, middle school and secondary teachers Leaders for schools (principals and superintendents), community colleges and universities Physical activity and health specialists including fitness leaders, physical education teachers, and pre-health professionals for athletic training, physical therapy and occupational therapy Educational researchers Recreational leaders Child development and family studies specialists Doctoral faculty for teaching in community colleges, colleges and universities Counselors to work in P-12 schools, colleges, universities, and clinical mental health settings Special education and gifted education teachers and leaders Our college is organized into four departments: Counseling and Higher Education, Educational Psychology, Kinesiology, Health Promotion, and Recreation and Teacher Education and Administration. Also, the Kristin Farmer Autism Center is housed in the College.  I invite you to explore the degree programs that we offer by visiting the department web pages. Please also visit the Student Advising Office for greater details on programs, or visit the Office of Teacher Education for interest in undergraduate teacher education. All of our degrees, undergraduate and graduate, require field-based experiences. We use a Professional Development School model in the preparation of elementary and middle school teachers—a well-documented method to produce effective teachers. Faculty in the College are scholar-practitioners who develop knowledge that is valuable to real-world settings. They collaborate with schools, community service organizations, government organizations and national/international colleagues. Their work and collaboration contributes to a society of well-educated, successful and healthy individuals. If you want to make a positive contribution to a society in which people develop happier and more meaningful lives, then a program in the College of Education is the place for you.
