Richmond was appointed tenured Professor and Dean of the College of Music at the University of North Texas on August 1, 2016. Previously, Richmond served as Professor and Director of the Glenn Korff School of Music at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL; 2003-2016) and as Professor and in various administrative appointments in the School of Music at the University of South Florida-Tampa (USF; 1987-2003). “Dr. Richmond possesses the leadership and experience needed to support and grow the reputation of UNT’s College of Music as one of the largest and most respected comprehensive music schools in the world,” said Finley Graves, provost and vice president for academic affairs at UNT. “His expertise in music and dedication to the arts will help our students and faculty continue their professional growth while enhancing the college’s connection to the greater Dallas-Fort Worth community.” During his tenure at UNL, Dr. Richmond guided the Glenn Korff School of Music (GKSOM) in the development of a strategic plan, the successful application for reaccreditation to the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), the successful application for initial accreditation to the National Association of Schools of Dance, the creation of new MM and DMA degree programs in Jazz Studies, the creation of a new Ph.D. degree in Music, the creation of a new string quartet residency, the recruitment of the Chiara String Quartet (www.chiaraquartet.net) to occupy that residency, the creation of eight new faculty lines, and the completion of 22 faculty searches. Finally, Dr. Richmond has helped UNL and the University of Nebraska Foundation expand its financial resources supporting music and dance such that the GKSOM endowments quadrupled to roughly $20 million. At USF, Richmond taught undergraduate and graduate courses in choral music education, choral conducting, arts education administration, and philosophy, and served as the Chair of the General Education Council, Vice Chair of the Research Council, and Interim Director of the School of Music.  He earned a bachelor’s degree in music education from William Jewell College, a master’s degree in choral conducting from the Conservatory of Music at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, and a Ph.D. degree in music education from Northwestern University. Richmond’s research focuses on arts education policy, legal issues in arts education, and the philosophy of music education.  He is published in the Journal of Research in Music Education, Research Perspectives in Music Education, Arts Education Policy Review, the International Journal of Music Education, the Journal of Aesthetic Education, and the Choral Journal, as well as a number of research monographs, including a chapter on Hindemith in On the Nature of the Musical Experience, edited by Bennett Reimer and Jeffrey E. Wright (Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1992). He is a Founding Director of the Suncoast Music Education Forum, the founding Editor of the Florida Choral News, and served as the Conference Director for the 1994 World Conference of the International Society for Music Education (ISME). Richmond edited the Policy/Philosophy Research Section of the New Handbook of Research in Music Teaching and Learning for Oxford University Press and also wrote its chapter on “Law Research and Music Education.” He contributed four biographical entries and an institutional article for the new AmeriGrove Project, a chapter for the Oxford Music Education Handbook, vol. 1, edited by Gary E. McPherson and Graham F. Welch, and a chapter for Composing Our Future: Preparing Music Educators to Teach Composition, edited by Michele Kaschub and Janice Smith. Dr. Richmond served a 3-year term on the Editorial Board of Arts Education Policy Review (2013-15). Richmond has appeared across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia as a guest conductor, speaker, clinician, and consultant. Recent speaking engagements include the 2012, 2013, and 2015 NASM National Conventions, the 2010 and 2014 ISME World Conferences (Beijing and Porto Alegre respectively), the 2007 World Conference of the College Music Society (Bangkok), the 2010 25th Anniversary Conference of the Center for the Study of Education and the Musical Experience (Northwestern University), the 2010 Mayday Conference on Music Education and Professional Ethics (Montclair State University, NJ), the 2013 Keynote Address to the Rocky Mountain Chapter of the College Music Society (Denver), a 2013 Nebraska Week Lecture on Interdisciplinary Research at Xi'an Jiaotong University (China), and the 2016 Summit on New Music Schools for the College Music Society (South Carolina).
