Check-issuing privileges are suspended while any return check and/or service charge are outstanding. If the university receives three or more returned checks, then both the check-issuing privileges and the online payment privileges of the individual are revoked. Checks made in an amount that is more than the balance due cannot be posted to the student's account and will be returned.
