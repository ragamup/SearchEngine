The university has hundreds of chemicals and toxins on campus, some hazardous. The university must comply with relevant Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Homeland Security, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and Texas Department of State Health Services standards.ENVM is responsible for regulatory issues such as, lab safety, storm water, waste disposal, radiation safety, mold abatement, cleanroom safety, asbestos abatement, refrigerant safety, chemical safety, nanomaterials safety, spill response, applicable Drug Enforcement Agency and Department of Transportation rules, biotoxin safety, biosafety, indoor air quality and industrial hygiene, and air emissions reporting. In addition, the ENVM Section is responsible for reporting all chemical and waste storage and disposal information to various agencies; for monitoring and reporting all lab incidences and violations that require increased training or lab shutdown until violations are resolved; and/or working with UNT Compliance and the Office of General Counsel to ensure all steps are taken to resolve violations. ENVM consults with departments on the main campus as well as Discovery Park to acquire chemical, biological, and radiological information, and to help manage those exposures. ENVM tests air in all buildings for any IAQ issues caused by chemical/biological/radiological materials. ENVM is responsible for the pickup and disposal of waste from all departments and campus vendors. ENVM must follow Resource Conservation and Recovery Act rules regarding disposal. The section is also responsible for taking steps to mitigate mold and asbestos, and monitoring vendors who remove these materials. Emergency Preparedness & Insurance Management (EPIM) is responsible for implementing and carrying out programs in support of UNT Risk Management’s mission of identifying, protecting, and conserving university resources while also supporting and furthering the university’s core mission. Emergency Preparedness focuses on preventing, mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from events that have the potential to negatively impact university personnel, property, and operations. Emergency Preparedness programs include health and food safety, fire and life safety, emergency management, business continuity, risk assessments, event safety, and various other programs that focus on protecting the university community. Insurance Management provides oversight and management of UNT’s risk finance programs to include procurement and placement of multiple lines of traditional insurance as well as self-insured programs. In addition, Insurance Management coordinates and manages a number of other risk functions to include claims management and investigation, loss prevention, contract review, workers’ compensation and return to work, athletic insurance claims management, youth camp procedures to include insurance and background checks, and training for those working with minors.
