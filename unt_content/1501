Its principles are universal. They can be applied with any population, including children with autism, people with developmental disabilities, parents and children, pet owners, college students, healthcare providers, athletes, employees, and CEOs. A career in behavior analysis will give you many options. Behavior analysts work in a variety of settings, including classrooms, large corporations, government institutions, health institutions, animal shelters, zoos, and in homes. Anywhere there are people, there is the opportunity to help individuals reach their full potential through improving their environment. Students from other fields, such as social work, special education, rehabilitation and addictions, health sciences, computer science and gaming, and neuroscience, will also find that a knowledge of behavior analytic principles can help them make better sense of the behavior of the individuals they work with and study.                                                        Visit Us Chilton Hall 410 S.
