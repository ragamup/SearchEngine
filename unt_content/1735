The ten writers are the winners of the writing contest of the Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference from the previous year. There are six winners -- three from the reported narrative category and three from personal essay. The four runners-up come from both areas. The top winners are awarded cash prizes and trophies at the Mayborn Conference in July and are published in the journal and on the website. Students and alumni of the Mayborn School of Journalism have been published in Ten Spurs. Any student who is not employed by the Mayborn School of Journalism by the writing contest deadline is eligible to enter. Details on the writing contest can be found at the Mayborn Conference website. The contest typically opens the first of each year.
