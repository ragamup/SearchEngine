There are several ways for you to accomplish this even before enrolling in your first class as an incoming freshman. By completing Advanced Placement (AP) courses and exams, College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) subject exams or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, you can earn academic credit and test out of some UNT courses. This, in turn, helps you earn your degree sooner and start your career earlier than other students. These courses and exams can be taken during high school, at another college or university or once you enroll at UNT. AP exams, necessary scores and equivalent courses are listed in the next section. (Information is subject to change.) CLEP and IB exams are reviewed by the dean who oversees your major to determine how they can apply to your degree. Credit by exam may not be: Used to reduce certain general requirements, such as completing 30 credit hours at UNT Granted for a prerequisite course Substituted for any grade (including an F) that you earned for a course in high school, at UNT or at another college or university The credit you earn from an exam won't be included in your GPA, but it'll be included in your accepted credit hours and on your UNT transcript. AP exams You'll need to complete an AP course offered by your high school to take an AP exam. Most Texas school districts offer the exams in May. Homeschooled students or students whose schools don't offer AP courses aren't required to complete an AP course before taking an exam. Here's a breakdown of available AP courses and exams, the credit hours that can be earned and our course equivalent.
