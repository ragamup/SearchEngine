John Murphy Chair, Division of Jazz Studies Jazz at UNT's blog King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand Submitted by Jazz at UNT on Thu, 10/13/2016 - 12:51pm We note with sadness the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who, among his many accomplishments, was a composer and jazz player. The One O'Clock Lab Band traveled to Thailand twice. King Bhumibol Adulyadej first met the One O'Clock Lab Band in 1967 at the White House. Neil Slater took the band there in 2004. The trip was documented in the CD/DVD Live from Thailand. Steve Wiest took the band there in 2009 to perform at the World Saxophone Congress with James Carter (photos).
