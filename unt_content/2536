The Conversation is made up of a diverse group of UNT students who are trained by our certified health educator in an area of interest, which includes smoking cessation, violence, sexual health, healthy relationships, body image, nutrition, wellness and fitness. Through specialized training, weekly meetings, hands-on experiences in program & event planning, social marketing, and leadership development, peer educators engage fellow students in health awareness campaigns and wellness events to improve the overall health of the UNT community. If you are interested in being part of the peer educators, applications are currently being accepted.  You can stop by the Meadows Center for Health Resources, Chestnut Hall 301 to pick up an application and get more information about the Conversation.  Questions about the Conversation can be directed to Israel Chavarria at 940-565-4554.  Visit Us Hurley Administration Bldg Mail Us University of North Texas 1155 Union Circle #305358 Denton, TX 76203-5107 Contact Us Technical issues?
