MW courses should continue to use the MWF pattern as a guide to identify their final exam time. MW courses that start on the half-hour should use the HOUR as a guide to identify their final exam time.  For example, a MW 9:30 course would use 9:00 a.m. as the start time. Evening Classes: have their final exams on the earliest usual class time this week. Classes with start times 5:00 p.m. and later are considered evening classes. Example: TR 5:00pm-6:20 would have their final exam on TUESDAY at 5 pm . Classes will meet in their usual classroom unless otherwise notified by their instructor.    Fall 2017 Final Exams - Main Campus Pre-finals days are Wednesday, December 6 - Thursday, December 7.  Reading Day is December 8 and no classes will meet.
