Additionally, he has performed in concert with the Canadian Brass, Rhythm & Brass, and with conductor David Robertson, at Carnegie Hall, as part of the Weill Music Institute.  He also enjoyed performing as a fellow at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. His debut solo album, On The Horizon, is available on the MSR label and has received rave reviews. In Fanfare magazine, Henry Fogel (Dean, Roosevelt University and retired president of the Chicago Symphony) said that Jason Bergman, “sounds like a world class soloist on this recording. He plays with style and elegance, a lovely legato where the music calls for it, and at the same time a strong internal rhythmic pulse. He understands the principles of tension and release in music-making, and he gets a nice range of color out of his trumpet.” Fogel also stated that Bergman’s “extremely vocal approach to playing his instrument reminds [him] of Herseth’s … and I can pay no higher compliment to a trumpeter.” (Fanfare Magazine) Dr. Bergman has given recitals and master classes at more than 30 institutions worldwide, including: Universidade de São Paulo, Universidade de Cantareira, Escola de Música de Piracicaba (Ernest Mahle), The Florida State University, University of Georgia, Baylor University, and Texas Christian University among others.

As soloist, Dr. Bergman has performed with the Garland Symphony Orchestra, the Southern Miss Symphonic Winds, the Brigham Young University Symphonic Band, and the Brigham Young University Philharmonic. Dr. Bergman joined the music faculty of the renowned University of North Texas College of Music in the fall of 2015. Prior to that, he was on the music faculty at the University of Southern Mississippi for 5 years. In 2014, he was named the Nina Bell Suggs endowed professor of trumpet at Southern Miss. The Suggs professorship is a prestigious university-wide award given to a junior faculty member showing great promise and achievement.  He has previously taught trumpet and chamber music at Albion College, University of Michigan, and the Conservatory of Music at the University of Chile in Santiago, Chile.  Additionally, he is also currently a faculty member at the Música nas Montanhas Festival in Poços de Caldas, Brazil. He has previously taught at the Semana de la Trompeta Peruana (Lima, Peru), the Festival de Música de Santa Catarina (Jaraguá do Sul, Brasil), the Grand Valley International Trumpet Seminar (Michigan, USA), and the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp (Michigan, USA). He also serves as an adjudicator with the National Trumpet Competition in Fairfax, VA. His students have achieved substantial success. His students have advanced every year since 2010 to the semi-final or final rounds of the National Trumpet Competition. His students have consistently won conference scholarships to the International Trumpet Guild Conference, positions in professional orchestras, and assistantships to leading graduate music programs throughout the country. Additionally, his students have attended the Britten-Pears Young Artist Program in England, Chosen Vale, the World Youth Orchestra, and worked with the Berlin Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.
