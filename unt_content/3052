Her vocal ensemble arrangements are published by Sound Music Publications, Hal Leonard, and Rosana Eckert Music and have been performed worldwide. Most recently, she co-wrote a jazz musical for young voices with popular children’s author and educator Sharon Burch titled Freddie the Frog and the Jungle Jazz (published by Hal Leonard).
