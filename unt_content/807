When requested by potentially eligible students who have early registered and meet all course requirements, UNT will provide these students opportunities to enroll during each fall and spring semester in the equivalent of at least 12-semester credit hours that apply toward their degrees. UNT is not required to provide students with the opportunity to enroll in specific courses or special sections. In addition, UNT will provide all students with appropriate forms and instruction for requesting a tuition rebate. UNT will remit rebates for eligible students within 60 days after graduation. If a student is found to be ineligible for a rebate a statement explaining why the student is ineligible will be sent. UNT will provide a dispute resolution process to resolve disputes related to local administration of the program and reserves the right to adopt rules and regulations for administering the program.
