Resident Meal Plans Most students living in residence halls (view details) are required to have a Scrappy or Eagle Resident meal plan. Both plans allow you to take advantage of our popular all-you-care-to-eat Cafeterias as often as you wish and include FLEX Dollars for use in our Retail Food Shops. How did we figure price per meal? Here is an example using the Eagle Super Flex (7 Days a week) Plan: For the longer version of this video with more details, click here. The best deal is the Eagle Super Flex plan. How much value? Well that depends on how often and how much you eat. There are three traditional meal periods (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) in a day. Our experience shows students can eat several more times in a day. Our Cafeterias serve continuously and students may eat as much as they want as often as they want — there are no limits! If you only eat three meals per day, then your average cost per meal is $4.13. If you eat a fourth meal, then your average cost drops to $3.10. If you eat five meals per day, then…well, you get the picture.  The Scrappy plans are also a good value; however they do not cover weekends or have a greater FLEX option. If you absolutely intend to spend every weekend off campus, then the Scrappy plan (Monday-Friday) is for you. However, if you stay on campus only one weekend per month, an Eagle plan (7 days a week) is the best value. This program allows you to visit any Cafeterria at any time as often as you wish when they are open. For Cafeteria days and hours, please visit our Dining Halls page.

Proof of Discovery Park class must be presented at time of purchase or conversion. SHUTTLE ROUTE - DISCOVERY PARK Most conversion Discovery Park meal plans change the traditional meal plan to a block plan with Disco Dollars and FLEX. Disco Dollars work like FLEX, but can only be utilized at the retail dining options in Discovery Park. The FLEX can be used at any campus retail dining location. The DP-Combo meal plan continues the unlimited Dining Hall meals and converts the FLEX dollars into a DP-Combo meal per day option. Payment Options Cash, checks, and all major credit cards are accepted for payment of meal plans. You can sign up online and pay with a credit card in full or come into our office to pay with check or cash. When you sign up in our office, you also have the option of paying in two installments for a Scrappy or Eagle meal plan. If there are questions regarding the purchase of a meal plan, please visit the Dining Services office located in Crumley Hall, Room 132. Our phone number is 940-565-2462.
