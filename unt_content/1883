for scholarship consideration using the on-line system at http://application.music.unt.edu. This should be done prior to the semester break to ensure an audition slot. Current students do not need to complete the entire application. Stop once you have selected the January audition day and send an email mafalda.chandler@unt.edu stating that you have applied to play a scholarship audition only. All other current students must apply for scholarship and/or scholarship renewal using the on-line system in FEBRUARY of each year at http://application.music.unt.edu and ask their private lesson teacher about additional requirements beyond the application, i.e. audition, audition recording (uploaded to your music Dashboard), etc.  Current students do not need to complete the entire application. Stop once you have selected “scholarship renewal only”.  Then, send an email to mafalda.chandler@unt.edu stating that you have applied for scholarship only. Other Awards for Continuing Students Nicholas and Anna Ricco Ethics Awards Scholarship Competition 2016 UNT Writing Awards Competition TA/TF Applications Teaching Assistantship and Fellowship RENEWALS and NEW APPLICATIONS must be submitted through the admissions application. When selecting an audition date, select the “No Audition - TA/TF Application ONLY” option. Current students do not need to complete the entire application. You should inform your department that you have made a TA/TF application, and check with your department to see if any other materials are necessary for your application (letters of reference, curriculum vitae, etc.). Once you have completed the required sections, send an email to devyn.dougherty2@unt.edu, including your student ID#, stating that you have applied to renew your assistantship/fellowship.
