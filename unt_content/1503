For instance, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) forecasts jobs for medical and health services managers to grow 23% between 2012 and 2022—considerably faster than the average percentage increase for most other occupations. Leaders in the current healthcare delivery environment seek employees with a broad-based graduate education. The Masters of Science in Health Services Administration offers the opportunity for graduates to assume leadership roles in healthcare delivery settings that serve a larger spectrum of the population. This program provides a foundation in health services administration while offering options for a specialized area of expertise. At the master's level, we currently offer concentrations in applied gerontology, health data analytics, long term care administration and rehabilitation services.   Degree Requirements The Master of Science in Health Services Administration requires completion of 36 graduate hours. These 36 hours include an 24-hour core curriculum and 12 concentration hours. Students must complete a capstone course prior to completion of the program. The capstone requires a comprehensive research project covering the student’s field of specialization. The project is designed to demonstrate the student's mastery of the discipline and ability to apply knowledge acquired throughout the program to solve a real world problem in the student's area of specialization under faculty supervision.
