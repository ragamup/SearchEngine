How can I find which online courses will be offered in future semesters? Online sections are listed in the Registrar's Schedule of Classes with the word "INET" shown instead of location.

If you live in the state of Texas, online courses generally cost the same amount as on-campus courses; the regular resident or non-resident tuition applies. Tuition and Fee Rates: <http://studentaccounting.unt.edu/tuition-and-fees However, if you currently reside out of state and do not have Texas residency, then an out-of-state teaching fee is assigned in lieu of tuition. Because our state funding does not reimburse the University for providing instruction to students residing outside of Texas, the individual departments set a teaching fee that must cover the cost of instruction. The out-of-state teaching fee is generally less than out-of-state tuition. For specific course tuition/fee information, you should contact the specific department offering that course. Departmental Directory (using Colleges & Schools menu) <http://www.unt.edu/colleges-schools.htm In addition, if you are taking only online courses during the semester, several fees such as the student recreation center fee and student union fee are waived.

Locate and contact the department number http://www.unt.edu/find-people-department.htm or use the colleges/schools directory: <http://www.unt.edu/colleges-schools.htm> or http://registrar.unt.edu/registration/get-advised I can't remember or don't know my EUID or password. Go to http://ams.unt.edu. There is a link on the left menu that reads "What's my EUID?" Click on this to find your EUID. There is also a link to activate your EUID (for new users), and a link to reset your password. If you need further help, you can contact the UNT UIT Helpdesk:http://www.unt.edu/helpdeskhelpdesk@unt.edu 940-565-2324 I can't log-in to MyUNT <http://my.unt.edu>. Go to http://my.unt.edu. You will need to log in with your EUID and password. If you need help with your EUID, go to http://ams.unt.edu. You may also log in as a Guest (click the "UNT Guest" button). A Guest log-in allows you to view the classes available for the current semester. I can't log in to Blackboard Learn. How to log in:http://learn.unt.edu ID/Password problems:https://ams.unt.edu/ If you continue to experience login problems, then contact Blackboard Learn Support:helpdesk@unt.edu 940-565-2324 Or you can contact Blackboard Learn Support through the Blackboard Learn Student Resources page:http://www.unt.edu/helpdesk/bblearn/ Why don't online courses I've registered for show up in Blackboard Learn? Unlisted Blackboard Learn Courseshttp://ecampussupport.unt.edu/index.cfm?M=Student_Resources&PF=faq#6 If your course still does not appear, it is likely that you have not yet been uploaded into that particular course. Most students are not fully uploaded until the first day of classes or sometimes even later in the first week of classes. To determine the first day of classes, see the Academic Calendar. If you continue to experience login problems or cannot see courses after the first day of classes, then contact Blackboard Learn Support:http://learn.unt.eduhelpdesk@unt.edu 940-565-2324 This is my first online course. How do I begin? On the first day of classes (see Academic Calendar), you should log into your course. You can do this by going to the Blackboard Learn Web site https://learn.unt.edu. Your username (EUID) and password here are the same as they are for http://my.unt.edu. You should see your online course listed on the left. Click on them to enter each one. You will see things such as a calendar, assignments, lectures, and a syllabus. Read through the syllabus and any introductory comments the instructor may have left. You will find information on expectations regarding the frequency of reading, accessing the Web site, posting comments, and so forth. Also, check the calendar or schedule for the next week for dates of assignments and any face-to-face meetings, if your course has any. If you don't see your course, please contact the UIT help desk at (940) 565-2324 or helpdesk@unt.edu. How do I know when and/or where a course meets? If some site-based meetings are required, how do I find out where to show up? This information should be listed with the course section on the Registrar's Schedule of Classes.  If it is listed as TBA, you should confirm meeting times and locations with your instructor. Then, log into Blackboard Learn and search for this information (usually available in the calendar or schedule). You can also email your instructor within Blackboard Learn if this course location information does not appear. If you cannot find information using either of the above methods, go to the course details section on http://my.unt.edu. Log into the Web site using your EUID. Then select "Academics" from the left-hand menu. Then select "Classes and Schedules," then "Schedule of Classes." Input the institution, career, and term information and you will be taken to the Course Search page. On this page, enter the course prefix and the catalog number. Once the course comes up, find the specific section for which you registered. Under the course name and number, there will be a section that lists any meeting date, time, and locations for the course. If a time and date are listed under the course details, but no meeting place, contact your instructor or the department for details (see below). If you are not familiar with the campus, you can find building locations and abbreviations listed on the Campus Map. If "TBA" appears here in the course details instead, it is likely that there are no face-to-face meetings. However, you should contact your instructor or the department to confirm (see links below). UNT Personnel Directory: http://info.unt.edu Department Contact Information: http://www.unt.edu/find-people-department.htm Where can I find the course syllabus? The course syllabus will be posted inside the course in Blackboard Learn. You can usually access it from the course home page or by selecting the "Syllabus" link on the left.  How do I find and order textbooks? You can check two locations for this information; occasionally there is conflicting information, and if that's the case, you'll need to contact the instructor about the correct text for the course. Go to the UNT Bookstore<http://unt.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/BNCBHomePage?storeId=71237&catalogId=10001&langId=-1>, and enter the appropriate information for your course. Textbooks should be listed here; you can order them from the bookstore site or you can get the information and purchase them elsewhere. Some instructors may provide information about textbooks on Blackboard Learn, but choose not to leave this information with the UNT Bookstore, so be sure to check. If no texts are listed at the UNT Bookstore, be sure to confirm this information with your instructor before or during the first week of classes. How can I contact my instructor? If you are able to log into your course on Blackboard Learn, you may email your instructor there. Otherwise, try using the Campus Directory at <http://info.unt.edu> or call the UNT Operator at 940-565-2000. I'm a student currently or formerly in the military.
