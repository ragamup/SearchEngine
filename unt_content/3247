Flying Dallas/Ft.Worth (DFW)approximately 30-45 minutes from Denton an American Airlines hub Dallas Love Field (DAL)approximately 45-60 minutes from Denton Southwest Airlines operates out of DAL If you are flying into DFW or DAL, we suggest renting a vehicle because airport shuttles and taxis are quite costly (shuttle average of $75/person/one way w/$15/person for each additional passenger). Hospitality Hill Hotels (Best Western Premier, Hilton Garden, and Courtyard by Marriot) are 3.7 miles from the building where the conference will be held. Shuttles from the hotels to the university will be available,but at set times only. Driving Denton lies at the top of the "Golden Triangle" whose other vertices are Dallas and Fort Worth. In other words, Denton lies where I-35E (from Dallas) and I-35W (from Fort Worth) come up from the South to rejoin into I-35, which continues north to Oklahoma City. The university itself is off of I-35E, about 1/2 mile south of the I-35E/W split.
