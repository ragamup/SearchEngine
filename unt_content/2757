Increasingly, the court system recognizes that divorce and child custody disputes are best resolved by parents with the assistance of qualified mediators. A family mediator serves as a neutral third party to help participants explore and find mutually acceptable solutions. The widespread growth of mediation creates the need for the university community to meet the challenge to produce graduates who are well versed in the area. As documentation that graduates are both knowledgeable and practiced in this subject, UNT offers a non-academic Certificate in Family Mediation. Certificate details Visit Us Chilton Hall 410 S.
