Our alumni represent the global legacy of the TAMS program, advancing medicine, chemistry, biology, law, business, computer science, education and the armed services. While the expertise and interests of the TAMS graduates take them all over the world, we know that all TAMS students, past and present, are bound by a unique set of common experiences. Parking lot tag, Boba tea, wing olympics, visitation, sock wrestling, LAN parties, closed weekends, wing meetings, seminar, and then of course the physics, bio and chemistry homework are just a few of the activities still common to the TAMS experience. We hope the friends you made here continue to have an impact in your lives and want to help you keep in contact with them! We also want to hear from you often and look forward to seeing you at our yearly alumni reception.
