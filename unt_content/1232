By developing their strengths people can achieve higher levels of academic, personal, and professional success. The StrengthsQuest™ assessment assesses and ranks your themes of talent and gives you a report of your top 5 talent themes. UNT is committed to helping our students discover and develop their talent themes. We provide access to the assessment and StrengthsQuest™ workshops through the UNT Orientation and Transition Programs office. You can request StrengthsQuest™ codes and a StrengthsQuest™ workshop for your department or student organization. You can also attend our general Intro to StrengthsQuest™ workshops that are open to the entire campus. Upcoming Workshops  Questions If you need additional information or have questions about the assessment or workshop, please contact us.
