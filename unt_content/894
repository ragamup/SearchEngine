Assistantships are limited to 20 hours per week, which is considered as half-time employment. Nine-month stipends range from $14,000 for entering master's students and up to $19,000 for PhD candidates. In addition, out-of-state and international students who are supported at least one-half time are eligible for in-state tuition. A limited number of Teaching Assistantships are available each semester, based on undergraduate enrollment in within the Biological Sciences. The Application for a Teaching Assistantship(.pdf) must be completed to be considered. This form requires Adobe Acrobat Reader to be viewed. You can download Acrobat Reader from http://get.adobe.com/reader. If you are interested in a Research Assistantship, you should check with your major professor concerning availability. All students who request either an RA or a TA are required to attend an orientation at the beginning of their first semester on campus. International students are required to pass the Test of Spoken English "Speak Test" in order to be eligible for a Teaching Assistantship. If you do not take the Test of Spoken English, you will not be eligible for consideration for a TA until the next offering of the test during the next semester. It is very important to arrange your arrival so that you are in Denton early enough to attend the orientation and take the Test of Spoken English. The test is usually during the first part of the week before classes begin. Scholarships and Fellowships There are a limited number of scholarships and fellowships offered through the Department of Biological Sciences and the Toulouse Graduate School. A list of available awards is on the TSGS website at http://tsgs.unt.edu/future-students/funding-your-graduate-education/awards. These awards are usually available for applicants wishing to start in the Fall semesters. If you are interested in these, you should make note that application deadlines are very early, often in early February. It is strongly suggested that you begin your application process 2-3 months before this deadline to make sure that your application is in order in time to apply. Most scholarship and fellowships will require separate applications and separate letters of recommendation. If you are interested, please make sure to indicate this to your major professor once accepted in order to learn about the requirements and forms. Beth Baird Tuition Scholarship Beth Baird Tuition Scholarships are intended to attract and retain outstanding graduate students to enhance scholarly activity within the Department of Biological Sciences.
