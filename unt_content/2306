Diversity Women's Faculty Network (WFN) Academic Integrity Academic integrity emanates from a culture that embraces the core values of trust and honesty necessary for full learning to occur. As a student-centered public research university, the University of North Texas promotes the integrity of the learning process by establishing and enforcing academic standards. Academic dishonesty breaches the mutual trust necessary in an academic environment and undermines all scholarship. See UNT Policy 06.003, Student Academic Integrity The Office of Academic Affairs and the Dean of Students office collaborates on issues of academic integrity. The Dean of Students office serves as the front door for reporting incidents and the Academic Integrity Officer works with faculty and students regarding the investigation. Please submit all questions related to academic integrity to academic.integrity@unt.edu. Flow charts for ease in reviewing the process have been created and can be found below. You will also find helpful links to complete the process.
