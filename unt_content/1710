Classroom Experience Students learn the fundamentals of writing, reporting and information gathering as they hone their skills completing assignments in feature writing, profile writing, investigative reporting, topical reporting, opinion writing, copy editing, print and online editing and design. Students also get hands-on experience using the latest audio, video, online and mobile tools to tell their stories to both local and global audiences. As reporters, students learn how to report issues fairly, thoroughly and accurately. As editorial writers and commentators, students learn how to persuade and inform in an ethical manner using editorials, columns and critical reviews of literature, performing arts and the visual arts. As editors, students learn newsroom management skills, and how to craft compelling headlines, arrange multimedia story components, review sources, determine newsworthiness and edit stories for a variety of print and online mediums. Students also have the opportunity to explore the art of literary nonfiction. In classes with the school’s writer- in-residence and other distinguished writing professionals, students will learn how to employ imagery, setting, dialogue, sensory detail and conflict to craft multi-dimensional characters, animated landscapes, and page-turning narratives. The school also hosts the internationally-recognized Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference. Mayborn equips student journalists with new technologies to tell their stories. Students receive instruction in desktop and web publishing, video/audio applications, databases, typography, podcasting, photography, videography and more. While working on assignments, students learn the essentials of online journalism, including writing and producing stories, interviewing, editing, using video and stills and reporting for the web. Students develop news stories based on Internet research skills, create original online newscasts and work with established radio, TV and newspaper staffs. Field Experience Under faculty supervision, students receive intensive, practical experiences with interviewing, writing, reporting, shooting, and editing stories for the North Texas Daily, NTTV, Denton Community Television and Denton Live magazine. As they work on daily publications, broadcasts and webcasts, students learn how to objectively cover all sides of an issue while working under tight deadlines and newsroom pressures. Additionally, there are many internship opportunities available in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the fourth largest media market in the nation. Facilities and Equipment Courses are taught in computer-based classrooms.
