Learning research skills, getting a faculty mentor, and gaining research experience are very important as you prepare for graduate or professional education. The more research experience you have, the more competitive you are for graduate and professional schools, and for funding for your graduate education. In addition, applied research experience can enhance your resume in a tight labor market. Students who participate in the Research Track are encouraged to present posters and research papers at conferences including University Scholars Day at UNT during the Spring semester. The Honors College is often able to provide a travel stipend to students who wish to travel to a conference to present their research. When the thesis is complete, you and your mentor are invited to submit journal-length articles for review for possible publication in the Honors College’s online undergraduate research journal, The Eagle Feather.
