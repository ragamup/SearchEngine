The Institutional Records Management Program assists the UNT System institutions by developing classification and retention strategies for all types of stored information and collaborating with all levels of the organization to put those strategies into operation. The mission of the program falls within two major goals: Develop effective records and information management strategies which achieve both compliance and cost savings for all UNT System institutions Provide the framework for information management education, awareness and innovation across all levels of the organization The Institutional Records Management Program is led by the Director of Institutional Records Management in the Office of Institutional Compliance. IRMP Updates Several months back, the IRMP was instructed to place a records hold on the following items due to Senate Bill 20: Employee Contracts, Purchase Vouchers, Grant Records, Contracts and Leases, Insurance Policies, Equipment History File, Equipment Service Agreements, Bid Documentation, and Requests for Information.  The records hold is now lifted for all records that met retention prior to September 2015.  If you have records that were included in the SB20 records hold, that met their retention after September 2015, they must be retained.  The records retention has changed for most of these items and will be reflected in the Records Retention Schedule (RRS) as soon as we receive notification of approval from the State. A notice will be sent out the Records Management Representatives once the RRS has been amended.  For any questions or concerns, please contact us at records@unt.edu or 940-565-4142.  News INhouse   Visit Us Hurley Administration Bldg 1501 W.
