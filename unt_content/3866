In addition, UNT community members may participate individually by placing content in UNT's Scholarly Works Repository. Each partner's materials add to the richness and scope of content in the UNT Digital Library. Benefits of Partnership Placing materials in the UNT Digital Library allows you to share your content with scholars, creatives, students, and lifelong learners at UNT and around the world. Items in the Digital Library are readily discoverable via Web search engines. Working with us also means that an electronic copy of your material is digitally preserved for the long term. How to Participate UNT institutional partners, please contact us directly to learn more about project feasibility.
