The Ph.D. degree is designed to provide the student with competence in several major areas of mathematics and to provide for intensive study and research in the area of specialization. Generally, the M.S. degree is designed for students who plan to use mathematical theory and techniques in fields outside mathematics, and the M.A. degree is designed for students who plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree for careers in teaching, business, or industry. Degree Requirements Doctor of PhilosophyUNT requires doctoral students to complete 72 hours of graduate work beyond the bachelor's degree or 54 hours of graduate work beyond a master's degree. Doctoral students are required to pass qualifying examinations in two areas, chosen from algebra, applied mathematics, complex analysis, probability & statistics, real analysis, and topology. The departmental provisions concerning the qualifying examinations may be found in the Qualifying Examination Policy. Students must write a dissertation and take a final comprehensive oral examination, which is primarily a defense of the dissertation. More information and the precise degree requirements for a Ph.D. may be found in the UNT Graduate Catalog.
