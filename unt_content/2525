The SHWC does not do allergy testing. You must be under the care of an allergist prior to receiving allergy injections at the SHWC. All new allergy patients are expected to have allergist instructions, orders, and serum before an appointment can be made with an SHWC provider for an allergy consult. A Treatment Nurse will call you once they have the all the required information to set up an allergy consult appointment. The SHWC allergy policy explains about allergy injections at the SHWC. If you have questions, please call 940-369-8203 or 940-565-2785 to speak to a Treatment Nurse.
