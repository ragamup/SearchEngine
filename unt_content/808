One or more summer terms occurring in the same summer is considered a semester. This plan locks in total academic costs until a student graduates or 4 years from initial enrollment in the plan, whichever comes first. An incentive for students who complete their degrees and meet eligibility requirements. The Eagle Express plan is available to undergraduate students who are Texas residents for tuition purposes and who are: New freshmen or transfer students Eligible new freshmen and transfer students are allowed a one-time opportunity to opt in to the Eagle Express plan during the first term they enroll at UNT. Eagle Express Tuition The total academic cost for tuition is expected to increase by 3.9% annually. Course fees are locked in at $195 per semester. This tuition rate will be locked in for 4 years or graduation, whichever comes first. Eagle Express Tuition Plan Annual Cost The students’ total academic cost based on enrollment in 15 credits per term is approximately $10,674 per year until their final year. NOTE: Taking courses in the summer rather than the long semesters will result in a higher total cost. Approximate Total Academic Cost for Final Year if Student Qualifies for Graduation Incentive: Graduation in up to 4 years with 0 -12 transfer credits: $7,674 Graduation in up to 3 years with 13-30 transfer credits: $8,674 Graduation in up to 2 years with 31-60 transfer credits: $9,674 Students who do not graduate at the end of 4 years are automatically moved to the Traditional Tuition plan effective for the next enrollment term. If students receive financial aid and/or scholarships, their Cost of Attendance (COA) will be reviewed and aid adjusted accordingly based on the incentive amount. Traditional Tuition and Mandatory Fee Plan (Fall and Spring Terms) Approximate total academic cost is based on enrollment in 15 credit hours per term beginning Fall 2014. Year 1: $10,094 Year 2: $10,478 Year 3: $10,878 Year 4: $11,293 Summer Enrollment Students enrolling during the summer semester will be charged the same Eagle Express tuition rates and the course fee amount will be $195, regardless of the number of hours taken during the summer.  Tuition and fee charts for the summer semester are posted online at studentaccounting.unt.edu/tuition-and-fees.  Eagle Express Graduation Incentive Students who enroll in Eagle Express and who complete their bachelor’s degree at UNT according to the following eligibility requirements qualify for an incentive in the form of a reduced tuition rate for the student’s final 15 hours. Eligibility for the graduation incentive is based upon how many hours a student completes at UNT and timeliness of graduation. New Freshman Eligibility for the graduation incentive for new freshmen is based on hours taken at UNT. Any college credit hours you earned before high school graduation do not count against new freshmen. For example, if you’re a 2015 high school graduate with 40 AP and/or dual credit hours, you would still be eligible for the $3,000 graduation incentive. **Transfer credit only includes hours transferred to UNT that were taken after high school graduation (new freshman only). Transfer Credits** Eagle Express Graduation Incentive Amount To qualify, student must graduate in no more than 12 hours or fewer $3,000 4 years 13-30 hours $2,000 3 years 31-60 hours $1,000 2 years Transfer Students Eligibility for the graduation incentive for transfer students is based on the number of hours taken at UNT. The number of credits transferred to UNT determines the incentive amount and the required graduation timeframe. Students with greater than 60 hours will likely not be eligible for the graduation incentive, but would still benefit from the reduced tuition rate if they graduate in the alloted time frame.
