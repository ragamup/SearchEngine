Home When planning your semester, consider which and how many classes you want to take. The next step would be to actually register and plan your semester. To get your planning started be sure to schedule an appointment with your academic advisor, and start reviewing the following UNT resources to sign up for classes. To stay on track for a timely graduation, we recommend you meet with your academic advisor at LEAST twice (2 times) a year: Between late September-October for Spring semester planning Between February-March for Summer and Fall semester planning Advisors will not pick your class schedule; however you can expect to work with them to identify potential courses to fulfill your degree requirements for your major, minor and certificate options. Be sure to come prepared with class options, ideas for your class schedule, and questions you have from your research within the “Signing Up for Class” section for your advising appointment.
