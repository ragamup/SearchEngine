We also appreciate your utmost patience as we work through the requests and responses we have received. Please find an update on the Texas State Service Verification Project below. As of April 10, the Records team has received more than 4,000 email inquiries regarding employees’ months of service throughout the entire UNT System. Currently, there are approximately 2,500 open and outstanding requests. UNTS Records is diligently working through these queries to provide accurate solutions to the remaining unanswered emails in the coming weeks. The reasoning behind a project of this magnitude is to deliver a one-time, manual cleanup effort correcting data that has, in some cases, been inaccurate in records for years. Ultimately, we will ensure that Texas state agency employment periods are recorded correctly. This project will allow transition into an automated system. Staff Members: Please note this project has NO relation to retirement service credit. The Texas State Service Verification project affects only benefits associated with vacation and longevity pay. Individuals employed at a Texas state agency AND assigned to a vacation/longevity pay-eligible position are included in this project. Faculty Members: While faculty are not eligible for vacation and longevity pay, we still record months of state service within Texas in the event that an individual transfers to a non-faculty role that is eligible for vacation and longevity pay. Other benefits of the Texas State Verification Project include: ·         Texas state service FAQs updated (attached). ·         Months of Service in EIS now display the number of state service days credited per month/year. ·         The verification page allows employees to better review updated information. For those who have not verified their months of service, we ask that you do so at your earliest convenience by following these steps: ·         Log in to EIS (MyUNT). ·         Select the Human Resources tab. ·         A pop-up message will appear with an option to review service; follow the prompts. For those who have verified your information, viewing your Texas state agency employment periods can be done by: ·         Logging on to EIS (MyUNT). ·         Select the Human Resources tab. ·         Select the Texas Service – Review Months of Service link. ·         The display is real time, and will include any recorded adjustments. We will continue to provide status updates throughout the closure of this project. We again thank you for your responses, feedback, and patience. Should you have any questions or concerns as we work through the remaining emails, please contact UNT System Human Resources: ·         Email:  stateservice@untsystem.edu ·         Phone: 878-855-7650, Option 4, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday   Cordially, Dorothy Cummings, MS-HRM Records Manager UNT System Human Resources Read about frequently asked questions.     Top Required Links Apply now Schedule a tour Get more info Main Menu Home Admissions Academics Student Life About UNT Research Athletics Giving University Links MyUNT EagleConnect Blackboard People & Departments Calendar UNT Map Jobs at UNT Colleges & Schools Specifically for Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Parents & Family Community Emails Graduate Admissions Freshman Admissions Transfer Admissions International Admissions     Find UNT on Google Maps 1155 Union Circle #311277 Denton, Texas 76203-5017   Visitor Information   940-565-2000   800-RELAY TX   Technical Issues Call us Email Us UNT Map Disclaimer | AA/EOE/ADA | Privacy | Electronic Accessibility | Required Links ©2017 University of North Texas
