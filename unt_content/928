Here are a few examples of what is important to the Padilla Lab Lab Dogs (& the occasional cat): Latte Padilla Latte- this cutest little ChiWeenie likes to snuggle, eat & go to the park to run. His favorite activity is eating gourmet food including celery, playing, sleeping and following his human around the lab or home. As a young pup he is still learning a few things but one thing he knows for sure is that he loves certain people- especially scientists that study worms. He does not like rain but is good with the lizards in his yard. His goal is to get better at yoga stretches and become a runner despite his little legs. Princess Padilla Princess-the cutest little ChiPuggy in Denton likes to bark at everything, snore while sleeping, snort when excited and be the boss of everything around her. Despite this attitude every human that meets her eventually wants to make friends with her- perhaps it is the funny puggy chihuhua face. Her goals include world domination and tasting all human foods. She shows her love by bringing toys to people, rolling on her back for a tummy rub and snuggling a long-lost college student buddy that once lived with her. Spike Rivera Spike- is an intelligent, amazing, attractive and active pure bred American Bulldog. Spike is hard to catch in a photo (who has time for photos?!) but, when he does decide to pose for a photo- it is indeed stunning and majestic. Spike is quite proud of his intellect, energy, beautiful freckles, and soft coat. Pure handsomeness! Cali Rivera Cali- the most special chihuahua corgi, likes to lay around and think about the interesting things in life such as what are the best doggie beds and why they do not make doggie bed with pillows! Prince Mungwira Prince is a thoughtful, short legged, dachshund that likes to hangout on the couch and ponder the important ideas of life- including doggie genetics. His favorite toy is anything stuffed and with a squeaker. Favorite activity is digging (hey I was bred for this!) and napping. Recently, he is contemplating the genetic similarity between he and Latte doggie...... and thinks more studies need to be done on doggie genetics. Emma Mungwira Emma the lovely is a beautiful Pit bull and Foxhound mix. Her favorite toy is- Everythingâ€¦ including DVD cases (yum!). Her favorite activity is taking selfies (of course she is gorgeous) and going for long walks. Her advice to all- smile for the selfies! Lab News: Mary Ladage had baby Zeke in July 2016. Welcome baby boy! Lee and Tasha moved to wonderful Colorado to work at the Medical School in Denver! Lab Running/Sports: Dr. Padilla finished another half marathon in December 2015, despite having a sinus infection.... She plans to do another race in 2016 and is recruting students that are interested in such.... run run... Daniel Quan did well in all the Tennis tournaments during his M.S. program! Fun Music Events: Dr. Padilla saw the Foo Fighters in an outdoor concert during a lunar eclipse- yes she LOVES Dave Grohl and Chris Shiflett and decided this evening was one of the best times ever (besides science times of course). Travel: The Padilla lab attends the C. elegans conferences and SACNAS meetings-of course. Dr. Padilla recently presented her work at Woods Hole in MA, UTSA and Trinity College in San Antonio. Skylar and Ripa recently presented two posters at te 2016 Aging, Stress, Pathogenesis C. elegans Meeting at UW Madison (2016). Thinking about UNT? It's easy to apply online.
