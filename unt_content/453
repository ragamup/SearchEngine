The Center for Learning Enhancement, Assessment, and Redesign (CLEAR) supports the University's goals of providing the best undergraduate educational experience in Texas and providing a superior graduate education by working closely with faculty to maximize their teaching effectiveness regardless of mode of instructional delivery. We assist faculty in the design and delivery of courses as well as with the measurement of learning at the class, department, and college level. We serve as the liaison for various administrative and technical support functions, thereby saving faculty's time, talent, and creative energies for their students. We provide leadership in the development of policies and the exploration of innovative tools and techniques that promote teaching excellence. CLEAR supports the UNT teaching community through workshops, seminars, conferences, individual consultations, production services, and the resources available on the CLEAR website with emphasis on aligning theory and practice for the roles required of university instructors in lecture halls, seminar rooms, virtual classrooms, and labs across all disciplines.
