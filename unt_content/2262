Prior to applying for Housing, take time to review information throughout the website including the accommodations available in each of the residence halls, information about the cost of Housing, and the opportunity offered by our Living Learning Communities so that you can make an informed decision when completing your application. Allocated space for freshmen and upperclassmen will be available on a first come, first serve basis.  Visit Us Crumley Hall UNT Housing 1621 W.
