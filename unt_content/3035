BuildingOffice #: M272Phone: 940-565-2229Courses taught, syllabi and curriculum vitae Born in Jefferson City, Missouri, Pat Coil (UNT, 1972-1976) is an extremely accomplished pianist, composer, producer, arranger, programmer, as well as a highly respected studio musician. If you watch television, listen to the radio, or go to the movies, you have heard Pat and some form of his music.  Pat has toured Japan, South America, Europe and the United States with such artists as Michael McDonald, Carmen McRae, Amy Grant, Vince Gill, Woody Herman and many others. Pat has recorded with Natalie Cole, Trisha Yearwood, Ernie Watts, Carmen McRae, BeBe & CeCe Winans, Travis Tritt, Peter Cetera, Scott Henderson, Woody Herman, Michael McDonald, and Olivia Newton John.  His talent spans the musical spectrum of pop, jazz, R&B, gospel, country…..Pat Coil is known for his work on Dionne and Friends (1990), Larry the Cable Guy’s Star-Studded Christmas Extravaganza (2008) and Mississippi Rising (2005).  Living now in Nashville with his wife and children, Pat continues his successful career composing, recording, performing, producing and arranging. He has composed, produced and performed on hundreds of underscores heard on a variety of media all over the world. Pat also teaches jazz piano, combos, and improvisation at Middle Tennessee State University, and is a member of the jazz faculty.  Pat has recorded six solo jazz albums of his own, the third one being a collaboration with Lyle Mays. True North and his new album Birdhouse are available at patcoil.com and cdbaby.com. A talented keyboardist, Pat Coil has thus far stuck mostly to the commercial side of jazz in his own projects. He began piano lessons when he was eight and, by the time he was a young teenager, Coil was leading his own bands, playing rock, country and a bit of jazz. While at UNT he performed with the One O’Clock Lab Band and gigged in Dallas and Fort Worth. His most notable association was playing, touring and recording with Woody Herman's Orchestra for 2 1/2 years in the late 1970s. After leaving Herman, Coil worked in Dallas as a session musician for five years. His band Recoil released two albums: Pardon My Fantasy and The Fantasy Continues. He had the opportunity to substitute for Lyle Mays with Pat Metheny's Group on a few occasions. Coil eventually moved to Los Angeles where he worked in the studios. He toured with Carmen McRae for a year, recorded with Ernie Watts, Nancy Wilson, Grant Geissman, Scott Henderson, Natalie Cole (her Unforgettable CD) and a variety of pop artists, and in the early 1990s recorded two solo albums for Sheffield Lab that fell into the "contemporary jazz" genre.
