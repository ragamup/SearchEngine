Because government documents are usually not intended for commercial publication, they don't necessarily follow the well-established practices of commercial publishing houses. The information needed for a good citation may be confusingly presented, or may not be present at all. Also, government documents vary widely in purpose, style and content, and none of the standard style manuals gives examples for citing all of these materials in a consistent fashion. Citing Legal Materials/Legal Style Manuals Lawyers and scholars of the law have developed their own methods of citing legal materials in such documents as court briefs and law journals. Some other general style manuals have also developed specific rules for citing legal materials. Citing Maps Many style manuals provide guidance on formatting maps that are used as illustrations in a paper or publication, but they may not be clear about the specifics of citing maps that are used as sources. Finding Reserve Materials This tutorial illustrates how to find materials placed on reserves. How to Find a Government Publication in the UNT Libraries This tutorial explains how to locate a government document in the UNT Libraries, how to interpret a federal documents or Texas documents call number, and how to interpret various location codes in the library catalog. How to Obtain United States Government Publications Information on how to locate and acquire various types of publications of the U.S. federal government.
