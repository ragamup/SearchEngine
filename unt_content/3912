Search the Catalog Here. What are Reserves? The UNT Libraries holds and distributes materials for faculty members as required or recommended reading for their courses. These materials are placed at a reserve desk within the libraries or are made available online and can include books, articles, chapters of books, sample tests, homework solutions, videos, CDs, and DVDs. Materials on reserves may be owned by either the libraries or the faculty member placing the item on reserves. Periodical volumes, reference materials, and non-circulating books are not placed on reserve. A limited number of materials, unrelated to courses, may also be placed on reserves at the discretion of libraries personnel. Government Documents, Special Materials, and Maps, which tend to be rare, delicate, or in high demand, have a more limited check-out period than those items in the general collection, and the fine rate is much higher. Textbooks Although we do not have copies of all the course textbooks, we do have many that have been placed on reserve by instructors or are part of the UNT Library collection. To determine if your textbook is on reserve, please go to our Find Course Reserve page or you may search for the title in the library catalog.
