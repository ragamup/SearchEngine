Campaign Development Board Giving to the COE College of Education › Higher Ed alum elected to state Board of Directors position Higher Ed alum elected to state Board of Directors position By Raquel Talamantes Hope Garcia, director of Student Services at UNT’s New College at Frisco and a 2015 graduate of the UNT College of Education’s Higher Education doctoral program, was recently elected to the Texas Association for College & University Student Personnel Administrators (TACUSPA) Board of Directors. “I have previously served as TACUSPA’s newsletter editor for two years and director of technology for three years,” Garcia said. “TACUSPA was the first professional organization I was introduced to, and it fits me well because there is a great deal of generalist work within student affairs that is included in my job duties. I enjoy working with my colleagues in TACUSPA, so being able to work closely with them on meaningful work is a pleasure.” Garcia was nominated for the position against a handful of other TACUSPA members. She will be in charge of managing the member and institutional database and reporting out membership status and increases to organization. She will also recruit new members. TACUSPA brings together administrators, staff, students and other higher education student affairs professionals across the state. “Historically, TACUSPA’s membership has been composed heavily from public, four-year institutions,” Garcia said. “I would like to work toward increasing the number of represented organizations and members from the varying levels of higher education — four-year, two-year, private, for-profit, professional and residential.” “Along with my colleagues, I also hope to work toward ensuring that the space TACUSPA provides is one that encourages the across-the-table talk and knowledge-sharing that would provide equal benefit to these various institutional types and in turn, a holistic benefit to higher education and the students and communities each of us touch.” With this new position, Garcia said she will strive to help institutions support students, goals and institutional livelihood.  Garcia will be officially sworn in at the TACUSPA Fall Conference in Dallas this October.
