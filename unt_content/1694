As a UNT student, you have the opportunity to gain practical experience through an internship or co-op that will enhance your classroom learning. Working as an intern or co-op student gives you a competitive advantage in the job market. These opportunities can also provide you with insight into your future career. We have successfully placed students in co-ops and internships with the following companies: ALCATEL USA Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.  General Electric IBM Microsoft Corporation  Motorola Nokia  Nortel Raytheon  Texas Instruments And many more! Earn School Credit While You Work There are several ways you can work while going to school: Parallel co-op allows you to work part time while simultaneously attending classes. Alternating co-op alternates semesters of work and school, so you work full time for a semester and then return to school full time. Internships allow you to work only one semester, often during the summer. Depending upon your major, academic credit can be part of your internships & co-op experience.
