We aim to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students as they reflect on and engage with their beliefs, values, purpose and ways of making meaning. Our Vision That all students, regardless of their respective worldviews and spiritual backgrounds, are inspired to better understand their own beliefs and values, as well as those of their peers, in pursuit of building a community of thoughtful and informed leaders, both on campus and beyond. Ultimately, we want the Office of Spiritual Life to become the primary destination for students looking to explore, evaluate, and engage with their own personal sense of spirituality. Spiritual Life Events The Office of Spiritual Life seeks to provide students with opportunities to improve their spiritual and/or religious literacy and opportunities for interfaith engagement.     Back to Top Better Together What is it? Better Together is a national movement of students who are bringing together people of different religious, spiritual, and nonreligious backgrounds to work towards a common goal. It's a network by students, for students - and at UNT, students who get involved will participate in community service activities and learn about ways to overcome religious and spiritual barriers to show our community that we are Better Together! How to Get Involved At UNT, we mean GREEN!  The Office of Spiritual Life has applied for a plot with the new UNT Community Garden with Student Sustainability/We Mean Green Fund, and we will have programs that focus on environmental stewardship and community service as expressed through different worldviews and spiritual traditions.Students will work together to learn about gardening and community service as we work to grow fresh produce for the UNT Food Pantry.  If you are interested in joining Better Together, please download and complete the registration form below and send the completed form to spirituallife@unt.edu.
