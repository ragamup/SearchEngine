At the University of North Texas, this market-centric collaborative culture is threaded deep in the fabric of our research efforts, where ideas converge into new theories, new disciplines and new, market-ready inventions that change society for the better. mc2 New uses for plants Finding ways to give foods and beverages more health-beneficial components to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease is just one of the many solutions UNT’s plant biologists are focused on. Added bonus: they might taste better, too. By discovering in more detail how the tannins that provide these health benefits develop in plants, researchers like Richard Dixon in UNT’s BioDiscovery Institute are making the most out of them. Dixon is direction of the institute and Distinguished Research Professor at UNT. Protecting performers Performing artists continue to work, despite tendonitis, muscle pain, hearing loss and much other injuries thanks to experts in music, medicine, engineering, psychology and public health who worked together to develop treatments. The Texas Center for Performing Arts Health, a joint effort of UNT and the UNT Health Science Center offers programs to treat and prevent those injuries. Fostering collaboration The Office of Research and Innovation launched mc2 (Market-Centric Collaboration) to foster faculty collaborative partnerships across multiple disciplines and to create a smooth process for delivering their discoveries in the market. Learn more about mc2. "It’s imperative that we help students discover and faculty innovate through their interdisciplinary settings and work. To be stewards of the public’s trust, universities must find new ways to ensure that new ideas, new solutions — music to materials technology — find a way to market so that communities and people who live in these dynamic communities thrive." --Michael Rondelli, UNT’s associate vice president for innovation and commercializationMichael.Rondelli@unt.edu 940-565-4459 The smallest details matter. Researchers got a better look at cancer cells with the patented technology developed by Guido Verbeck, associate professor of chemistry. Verbeck has developed tools for medical, manufacturing, environmental, law enforcement and other fields.
