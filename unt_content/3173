earned the esteem of the public and his colleagues alike. Having risen to international prominence, he has distinguished himself with some of the most critically acclaimed performances and recordings of his generation, inspiring many, including Sviatoslav Richter and Alicia de Larrocha, to praise him for his extraordinary musicianship. In the years that followed, Viardo collaborated with the world’s leading orchestras, including the Royal Philharmonic, the Moscow Philharmonic, the Leningrad Philharmonic, the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Israel Philharmonic, the Atlanta Symphony, the Prague Philharmonic, and many others. Like a handful of other celebrated Soviet artists, from Nuryeev to Egorov, Viardo’s journey to the west began under an ominous political cloud. No matter that, by the time he was 23, his future was already assured with impeccable credentials, several additional competitions wins- including a top prize at the Concours Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud in Paris - and a command of more than 37 concertos, Viardo fell victim to demands of the Soviet authorities. Detained behind the Iron Curtain, Viardo threw himself into his work, only to emerge with even greater determination, now buttressed by exemplary artistic refinement, to bring his art to music lovers everywhere. With the onset of Perestroika, the Soviets at last allowed Viardo to accept engagements in Germany and the United States. In 1989 the North Texas College of Music appointed Viardo to its distinguished faculty, where he soon established a reputation as an extraordinary coach and teacher. His roster of students includes young artists from Europe, the Americas, South Africa, and Asia, many of them competition winners themselves. Viardo's master classes are much in demand throughout the world , and his philosophy of teaching is detailed in Benjamin Saver’s The Most Wanted Piano Teachers in the USA. After returning to the West, Viardo’s international career resumed with several concerts at Carnegie Hall, the Lincoln and Kennedy Centers, Salle Pleyel, and the Concertgebouw. His concert tours have taken him to leading American, Canadian, and European cities, to Asia and South Africa, as well as to Israel and Central and South America, where he has appeared as a soloist with most of the important conductors in the world, not the least of whom are Mehta, Maazel, Davies, Susskind, Shippers, Kondrashin, Spivakov, Giordano, and M. Shostakovich His numerous recordings for Melodia, Pro Arte and Nonesuch have been greeted with unanimous critical acclaim.
