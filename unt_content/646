Just 40 miles from Denton, the Dallas-Fort Worth area is internship central, with the fourth highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the U.S., which makes it easier to score the internship you need for the career you want. We're also the proud education partner of The Dallas Cowboys. This partnership creates new academic experiences, including exposure, opportunities for engagement and internships.
