In between these opposed perspectives we find responses to the war, both critical and laudatory, from poets who did not enlist, including women on the home front and those in active service as nurses. To set these perspectives in context, we include sections on visual images of war, particularly photography and poets' responses to this documentary technology, and retrospective collections that advocate for peace in the aftermath of the Great War and on the eve of World War II. The exhibit can be viewed any time during our regular hours:  9am to 5pm Monday through Saturday January 15 - May 11, 2017 Willis Library Room 437  The exhibit can also be viewed any time through The Lost Generation: World War I Poetry online exhibit.  Where: Willis Library Room 437 When: Tuesday, January 17, 2017 - 9:00am - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - 5:00pm How much: Free Sponsor: UNT Libraries Special Collections Event open to: Open to the public Website: The Lost Generation Exhibit Contacts: Jaimi Parker jaimi.parker@unt.edu 940-565-2769 University of North Texas 1155 Union Circle #311277              Denton, Texas 76203-5017 Phone: (940) 565-2000 People & Departments   Undergraduate admissions Graduate admissions International admissions Housing information For questions about content in this web site, contact urcm@unt.edu.
