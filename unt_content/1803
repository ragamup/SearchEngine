Many of our students have gone on to teach and lead prestigious university programs, a number of very successful professional and community-based choirs and outstanding public school programs across Texas and the nation. UNT graduates have held important national and regional leadership positions in our professional organizations including the most prestigious positions in ACDA and TMEA. Our conductors and singers are provided with exposure to many of the most important pedagogues and conductors of the American choral art. The UNT choral singing program is comprised of eight ensemble opportunities. In addition to participation in the university choirs, students regularly perform with the choruses of the Dallas Opera, Fort Worth Opera, the Dallas Symphony Chorus, Denton Bach Society, Schola Cantorum of Texas, and the Turtle Creek Chorale. A significant number of our students hold positions in professional choirs in the metroplex, including the Dallas Bach Society, Helios, Orchestra of New Spain, and Orpheus Chamber Singers.
