CAMERA OBSCURA May is National Photo Month To take a photograph is to freeze a moment in time. Within this moment, infinity can exist: an infinite amount of time, of emotion, of reflection. It is no wonder that since the first photo was taken in 1826, photography has become a universal art form. Anyone can take a photo, and anyone can learn how to take a better photo. Everyone can appreciate a good photo. To celebrate National Photo Month, come check out UNT Libraries' collection of captivating art photography books and helpful video courses on photography streaming online. Whether admiring someone else's photo or taking one of your own, we can all appreciate the arresting phenomenon of capturing the nebulous mystery of experience.
