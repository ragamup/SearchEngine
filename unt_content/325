Cayuse 424 became an available option in the Fall of 2015. Your proposal approval documents will be routed to OGCA through Cayuse SP. OGCA will submit your proposal to the sponsor through Cayuse 424, a web-based "system-to-system" proposal submission program. The Cayuse 424 proposal replaced the federal "Grants.gov package" in Adobe pdf format. When your proposal is prepared in Cayuse 424, it may be linked to your electronic routing record in Cayuse SP. If your proposal is developed in NSF's FastLane or some other electronic sponsor system (NASA's NSPIRES, etc.) you are not required to use Cayuse 424.
