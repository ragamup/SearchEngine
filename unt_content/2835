What are the rules of thumb and basic elements of info-doodling? What are some strategies to strengthen comprehension and memory? What will you create as your first professional visual note during the lecture? Please have writing utensils and paper to practice on. An excerpt of something you would like to take notes on would be great! This lecture was hosted at The Agora, in room G150, at Discovery Park (3940 North Elm Street, Denton, TX 76207).
