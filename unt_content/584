Eagle Connect for Retirees Retirees may request an EagleConnect account as an alternative to keeping their UNT Exchange account upon retirement. This option is found within the exit paperwork filed with HR or may be requested after by contacting the UIT Help Desk. Important for Retirees: please note the following information. A new email address in the form of FirstLast@my.unt.edu will be created. Upon request, the existing UNT Exchange alias (usually First.Last@unt.edu) can deliver mail to the new EagleConnect address. No mail from the UNT Exchange account will be transferred to the EagleConnect email address. Retirees will need to forward any existing mail to the new address if they wish to keep it. OneDrive will not be included; OneDrive is a service only available to current students and is explained in the FAQ above. The options below are available to the general public and may provide as alternatives for retirees. UNT does not support these services should trouble arise. Any free Microsoft® Live account comes with seven gigabytes, 7 GB, of OneDrive cloud storage and basic Office Web Apps. This includes Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and the OneDrive desktop application for syncing files to your computers. Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium is a paid-subscription based service that comes with 20 GB of OneDrive cloud storage, access to Office Web Apps, and the Office desktop applications you're used to using. Microsoft® Office 2013 can be purchased for use on a single computer and includes the Office desktop applications you're used to using. Google Drive with Google Docs comes with 15 GB of free storage and may serve as an alternative to Microsoft® OneDrive with Office Web Apps. ​​Can't find an answer? Ask for help from the UIT Help Desk by submitting a numbered, trackable request for service through the IT system: Request for Service.
