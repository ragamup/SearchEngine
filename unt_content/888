Crawford Biological Sciences Scholarship Tracey Lynn Quay Memorial Scholarship Outstanding Senior Award FOCUS Program The FOCUS (Fostering Outstanding Cohorts in Undergraduate Sciences) scholarship program for first-year biology, biochemistry, and chemistry students is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The program accepts 24 students each year based on financial need, with top consideration going to students who belong to a population that is underrepresented at universities and first-generation students. Students receive between $1,000 and $7,000 per year depending on their level of need, for their first two years of study. Students are encouraged to travel through their core science classes as a group, with seats being reserved for FOCUS scholarship students in sections of required courses. FOCUS students are also strongly encouraged to become involved with the REAL (Residents Engaged in Academic Living) community for biology majors to foster a support system among the involved students. Read an article about REAL communities. FOCUS students are paired with faculty and graduate student mentors, which give them the opportunity to work in laboratories, an opportunity that is typically reserved for upper-level students. Students also take a seminar class on how to be successful in science careers during their sophomore year, which provides opportunities to learn about research methods and opportunities. The seminar also helps students learn how to fund their junior and senior years by teaching the students about departmental, state and national financial aid resources. Learn more about the UNT-FOCUS Undergraduate Research Program. UNT-HHMI Undergraduate Research Program Through a generous grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the UNT-HHMI Undergraduate Research Program offers current UNT junior and senior biology and biochemistry majors the opportunity to engage in a PAID research experience in the laboratory of an active UNT biology or biochemistry researcher for up to one year. Students will also receive stipends for printing research posters, stipends to travel to a conference (for those students participating in at least two semesters in the program), and a stipend for laboratory supplies. Students may enter the program at the beginning of the fall, spring, or summer semesters, and may be eligible for up to 3 semesters of support. Placement of participants with a research mentor will be coordinated between the UNT-HHMI Advisory Board, research mentors, the program coordinator, and the selected students. Learn more about the UNT-HHMI program. Internship Opportunities You may work in a job related to your major through the UNT Internships and Cooperative Education office. More than 4,000 employers work with the office to provide excellent learning opportunities and real-world work experience. Internships can last for one full semester or summer. Co-op employers pay extremely well, and the jobs usually last several semesters, often until graduation. Some of these opportunities may become full-time positions upon graduation.
