This is in recognition of the university’s strong and growing biobased products program. The Institute will support the university on its path toward national prominence. The institute delivers research solutions to underpin the utilization of plants, forest products and other biomass for production of biopolymers, new bio-based materials for construction and transportation, bioactive small molecules and biofuels. The institute operates through a pipeline linking sustainable plant production platforms, metabolic engineering and the development of new materials. The institute touts a multidisciplinary team of researchers committed to collaborating on large research projects with an emphasis on application of findings and solutions to meet market issues and needs. THE MISSION OF BDI is to leverage existing UNT strengths while identifying opportunities to play a national and international leadership role in the basic understanding of plant processes and materials for the development of a sustainable and environmentally friendly bio-based economy.  Areas of Expertise: Biobased Materials Biopolymers Bio Active Small Molecules Mass Spectrometry Plant Metabolic Engineering BDI is led by world-renowned plant scientist, Dr. Richard Dixon.
