William Fulbright to increase the mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through international educational exchange programs. The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. The Fulbright Program provides research, study, teaching, and other collaborative opportunities for U.S. students (graduating seniors and current graduates students); U.S. faculty, staff, and recent post-docs; and U.S. institutions interested in hosting visiting Fulbright Scholars from around the world. Currently, the Fulbright Program operates in over 155 countries worldwide. The Fulbright Program awards approximately 8,000 grants annually. Roughly 1,600 U.S. students, 4,000 foreign students, 1,200 U.S. scholars, and 900 visiting scholars receive awards, in addition to several hundred teachers and professionals. There have been more than 25 UNT Fulbright Student Grantees since 1967 and more than 30 UNT Fulbright Scholars since 2005 as well as visiting Fulbright Scholars to UNT. Applying to Fulbright UNT students: are required to apply through UNT and should contact the UNT Fulbright Program Advisor and Scholar Liaison to begin the application process. UNT faculty/staff: are encouraged to contact the UNT Fulbright Program Advisor and Scholar Liaison about applying to the Fulbright Scholar Program or hosting a Visiting Fulbright Scholar at UNT.
