Of those entries, 123 pieces from 15 universities and schools across the nation were chosen for the show. “I’m very proud of the communication design students and faculty,” said Alex Egner, associate professor of design. “The DSVC National Student Show is the largest event of its kind in the country, so these results are a real testament to everyone’s hard work and determination.” CVAD Dean Greg Watts added, “Once again our students -- and our faculty -- have demonstrated why our reputation is so strong. This is a significant win for communication design, CVAD and the whole of UNT.”   Best of Category Awards ($250 each) Packaging Design: Anna Price for Kate Weiser Chocolate— Professor: Karen Dorff Posters: Jake Watson for NYC Horror Posters— Professor: Alex Egner Magazine Covers/Spreads: Emma Pattison for Our Fancy Foods— Professor: Alex Egner Annual Reports: Kimberly Hanson for Target Annual Report— Professor: Karen Dorff Website Design: Anna Price for Library of Congress Website— Professor: Clinton Carlson Mobile App Design: Jason Ortiz for Guru— Professor: Clinton Carlson Motion Graphics: Christian Dodson for Atlas Obscura Animation— Professor: Alex Egner Illustration, single and series: Po-Hui Chou for Science Refutes God Illustration— Professor: Karen Dorff Total Campaign: Ian Anderson for Star Hopper Campaign— Professor: Alex Egner   Choice Awards: Chairman’s Choice Award: Anna Price for Kate Weiser Chocolate— Professor: Karen Dorff Educators’ Choice Award: Tylee Marsh for 23 & Me— Professor: Karen Dorff People’s Choice Award: Jessica Perry for SwingLine Shredders— Professor: Alex Egner   Judge’s Choice Awards ($500 each): Anna Price for Library of Congress Website— Professor: Clinton Carlson Kimberly Hanson for Target Annual Report— Professor: Karen Dorff Christian Dodson for Atlas Obscura Animation— Professor: Alex Egner   Portfolio Awards 3rd Place Senior Portfolio: Nic Begley ($1,000) 2nd Place Senior Portfolio: Anna Price ($2,000)   Golden Apple Award: Best Educator Award nominated by student essay Principal Lecturer Karen Dorff   Best School Award ($1,000): University of North Texas UNT News Service Phone Number: (940) 565-2108 Contact: (940) 369-7912 Email: courtney.taylor@unt.edu Follow us Visit Us University Service Building 2310 N.
