The department will provide information concerning the exams in the graduate studies catalog as well as any literature put out by the department that describes our graduate program. The information should include the number of exams to be taken, topics, times exams are offered, and amount of time including number of allowed attempts given to pass the exams. It will be emphasized to students in writing within the catalogue and in person by the chair or relevant graduate advisor that passing the qualifying exams is necessary, but by no means sufficient for earning a Ph.D in mathematics. 2. A student must pass two qualifying examinations (in different areas: real analysis, complex analysis, topology, algebra, probability and statistics, and applied mathematics) prior to registering for dissertation hours (in mathematics). 3. The exam times will be at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters: August and January. Two qualifying examinations must be passed by the end of the first January exam period following the seventh semester of graduate studies in mathematics (initiated at the University of North Texas). Students failing to meet this requirement will be removed from the Ph.D. program after the spring semester following their seventh semester. In addition, at least one qualifying examination must be passed by the end of the first January exam period following the fifth semester of graduate studies in mathematics (initiated at the University of North Texas). For students failing to meet this requirement, the Graduate Affairs Committee will recommend to the department chair termination of financial support after the spring semester following their fifth semester. Exceptions to the above rules can be made only under extenuating circumstances and with the approval of the Graduate Affairs Committee. 4. A student has at most six attempts to pass two exams within the time constraints mentioned above. A student may attempt examinations in any of the six areas (real analysis, complex analysis, topology, algebra, probability and statistics, and applied mathematics). Students are not allowed to continue in the graduate program if they have not passed two qualifying examinations after six attempts, except under extenuating circumstances and with the approval of the Graduate Affairs Committee. 5. Each exam subject area will have a syllabus that contains a detailed list of topics covered by the exam, together with suggested readings. Old exams will be made available to students. 6. Digital copies of the ungraded exams are kept by the department until the student graduates, or until five years have passed. Graded exams will not be returned to the students, but students may consult with the chair of the area committee to view a copy of their ungraded exam and receive feedback on their exam performance.
