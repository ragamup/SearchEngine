Prescription Insurance  The SHWC Pharmacy accepts the University endorsed student insurance policy with co-pays of $10 for generic drugs, $35 for brand name drugs for up to a 30 day supply.  As of October 1, 2012 students on the student insurance plan can receive most contraception, including birth control pills, at no co-pay. The SHWC Pharmacy also accepts some outside prescription insurance cards, like Medco, PAID, Caremark and Blue Cross, that contain one of the following BINs (bank identification numbers): 004336 610029 610239 610415 610502   If unsure whether we file your prescription insurance, just present your card at the SHWC Pharmacy and we can let you know if we accept that insurance plan.  If we do not accept your insurance plan, we will be happy to give you a price check as we try to keep our prescription prices affordable, even without insurance. At this time we are unable to accept Tricare insurance. Special Orders  If the SHWC Pharmacy does not stock the medication you need, we may be able to special order it for you.  Before the order is placed, we will give you an estimated price and have you sign a form that states the conditions for the special order.  Refills for the same medication will not require you to sign a new form.  Just call us a few days prior to needing the medication. Over the Counter Medications (OTCs)  SHWC Pharmacy also offers a variety of OTC products, including Plan-B, for purchase without a prescription.  This service is open to students, faculty and staff with a UNT identification card.  Click here for a list of current items. Other Services  We also welcome any medication questions and are happy to provide you with oral and written information about any medication. Payments Payment is expected at the time of service.  We accept cash, check, and credit card payments (American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa).  Insurance co-pays and over the counter (OTC) medications not prescribed by a medical professional must be paid in full before receiving medications.  Patients with OTC medications prescribed by a medical professional or those who are not filing with insurance to cover their prescriptions may make payment arrangements if they cannot pay in full for their medications. Medical Records The SHWC Pharmacy will not disclose Protected Health Information about our patients without prior written consent from the patient on a per request basis.  For patients under 18 years of age, parents may request most medical information.  Call for details at (940) 565-2790.
