As traditional news rooms shrink, the field of public relations is enjoying a renaissance due to the ability to bypass traditional media outlets and communicate directly with information consumers via online media. Journalists have always shifted careers from news to public relations but are often lacking in theoretical and strategic thinking skills necessary for success in public relations. The Graduate Certificate in Public Relations is positioned to aid in making that switch as well as to provide additional education for current PR practitioners wishing to increase their knowledge as they move into management positions. Professionals in other fields (such as advertising, HR and emergency management) who find themselves responsible for public relations will also benefit from obtaining the certificate. Students will be prepared with the latest academic and professional material including an overview of the knowledge, skills and abilities required to obtain the Accreditation in Public Relations (APR) credential. Professionals will complete nine hours of required courses and six hours of electives in the Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism. Up to 15 hours will apply toward a master’s degree for those who wish to pursue an advanced degree in journalism. Please see information regarding gainful employment data. The Mayborn Graduate Institute is offering five courses in the certificate program that entails periodic seminars, workshops and other gatherings for professionals designed to teach exceptional writing, editing and other skills needed in the ever-evolving world of nonfiction publishing. Admissions To enroll in the Mayborn Graduate Institute’s 15-hour Graduate Certificate in Public Relations, candidates will apply to UNT through the  Toulouse Graduate School website and will send official transcripts demonstrating completion of a bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree. The Graduate Record Examination is not required. Departmental admission requirements include submitting a portfolio of professional work including writing samples following these guidelines. Portfolio not required if candidate has already earned Accreditation in Public Relations (APR) certification.
