The competition is designed to reward creative solutions that cut across traditional functional boundaries. While team members can use expertise developed within their own major to provide insights on the company's problems, these insights must ultimately be merged with those of students from other majors to provide a coherent whole. In doing so, the students are forced to consider how their own functional area can be integrated with other functional areas. The competition encourages students to take a big picture perspective and understand that while each particular function can add value, this value will only be captured if the firm is able to integrate the information in a timely and logical manner.
