Contact Us Cost of Attendance Worried about taking out too many student loans for a music degree?  Want to get an education at a world-class music school without paying $40,000 (or more) per year for tuition?  UNT's College of Music may be the choice for you. We compared the cost of an education at UNT with more than 20 other schools with the best music programs in the U.S., and came up with some surprising facts: Avoid Texas-sized expenses in Texas.  UNT's total undergraduate expenses (including tuition, fees, room and board, and other expenses) are lower than those at UT – Austin, University of Houston, or Texas Tech, and about half of those at Baylor, TCU, Rice, and SMU. Out-of-state or an international student?  Compared with some of the best music schools outside of Texas, UNT has the lowest out-of-state tuition and fees rates, and the lowest estimated undergraduate expenses.  The College of Music also offers even lower in-state rates to any student receiving a competitive scholarship of $1,000 or more. Don't be fooled by large scholarship offers at other schools.  A $10,000 scholarship sounds like a big deal… unless your tuition is $40,000 a year.  At UNT, your average undergraduate cost after financial aid is lower than any other school we compared. In the 2015–16 school year, the College of Music awarded a total of $945,512 in merit scholarships which assisted over one third of our students.   A graduate degree you can afford. UNT's graduate out-of-state tuition and fees are the lowest of any school we compared.  In the 2015-16 school year, 177 graduate students received teaching assistantships or fellowships. All new full-time teaching assistantships and fellowships covered 3 hours of tuition and fees for master's students, and 6 hours of tuition and fees for doctoral students. These full-time assistantships and fellowships also included an employment waiver, allowing for non-Texas resident to pay in-state tuition.
