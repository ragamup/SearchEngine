New Publication: ALKBH7 Variant Related to Prostate Cancer Exhibits Altered Substrate Binding Dr. Andrés Cisneros, and others, recently published "ALKBH7 Variant Related to Prostate Cancer Exhibits Altered Substrate Binding" in the February 2017 issue of PLoS Computational Biology. Abstract: The search for prostate cancer biomarkers has received increased attention and several DNA repair related enzymes have been linked to this dysfunction. Here we report a targeted search for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional impact characterization of human ALKBH family dioxygenases related to prostate cancer. Our results uncovered a SNP of ALKBH7, rs7540, which is associated with prostate cancer disease in a statistically significantly manner in two separate cohorts, and maintained in African American men. Comparisons of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the wild-type and variant protein structures indicate that the resulting alteration in the enzyme induces a significant structural change that reduces ALKBH7’s ability to bind its cosubstrate. Experimental spectroscopy studies with purified proteins validate our MD predictions and corroborate the conclusion that this cancer-associated mutation affects productive cosubstrate binding in ALKBH7.

New Publication:Investigating carbohydrate based ligands for galectin-3 with docking and molecular dynamics studies Dr. Andrés Cisneros, and others, recently published "Investigating carbohydrate based ligands for galectin-3 with docking and molecular dynamics studies" in the January 2017 issue of ournal of Molecular Graphics and Modeling. Abstract: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a carbohydrate binding protein that is overexpressed in several types of cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which makes it a good target for both imaging and therapeutic drug design. A ligand library specialized for 18F positron emission tomography (PET) has been investigated with molecular dynamics (MD) and free energy methods to determine the relative binding energies of various potential ligands. Our results suggest that traditional docking methods can give good results when complemented by molecular dynamics and free energy methods for these types of ligands. Available experimental binding affinities for a small number of the tested compounds show very good agreement with the calculated energies and provide the rational approach for design of Gal-3 ligands with even higher affinity.

CASCaM professor awarded ACS grant to study new catalysts Dr. Thomas Cundari, Chemistry, has been awarded an American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF) grant to study new catalysts for selective oxidation of light alkanes such as those found in petroleum and natural gas. Despite considerable research since the seminal work by Shilov in the 1960’s and recent advances in C-H bond functionalization for fine chemical synthesis, the petrochemical field is not close to a practical catalyst for selective oxidation of light alkanes. In this research, experimentally relevant, synthetically plausible, Earth-abundant oxo complexes capable of oxidizing the strong, inert aliphatic C–H bonds of light alkanes found in natural gas and petroleum will be identified through state-of-the-art computational chemistry methods. These catalysts are based on the active site of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (EBDH), which uses the Earth-abundant metal, molybdenum, to catalyze the transformation. We seek to identify mimics of this biological catalyst that can activate C–H bonds stronger than the benzylic bond of ethylbenzene, i.e., those of light alkanes. The mechanism of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase has several interesting differences from the mechanism for the more well-studied cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including simultaneous transfer of a proton and hydrogen atom to MoVI=O to yield an aqua complex, MoV–OH2. Moreover, dithiolene supporting ligands raise the possibility of using their redox non-innocence to control oxidation in ways not possible with existing families of catalysts for light alkane oxidation. These differences provide the impetus for this New Directions proposal. If successful, this research would yield new design paradigms in the catalytic functionalization of refractory hydrocarbon substrates such as light alkanes. New Publication: Mutations along a TET2 active site scaffold stall oxidation at 5-hydroxymethylcytosine Dr. Andrés Cisneros, and others, recently published "Mutations along a TET2 active site scaffold stall oxidation at 5-hydroxymethylcytosine" in the December 2016 issue of Nature Cehmical Biology. Abstract: Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes catalyze stepwise oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (mC) to yield 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and the rarer bases 5-formylcytosine (fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC). Stepwise oxidation obscures how each individual base forms and functions in epigenetic regulation, and prompts the question of whether TET enzymes primarily serve to generate hmC or are adapted to produce fC and caC as well. By mutating a single, conserved active site residue in human TET2, Thr1372, we uncovered enzyme variants that permit oxidation to hmC but largely eliminate fC and caC. Biochemical analyses, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, elucidated an active site scaffold that is required for wild-type (WT) stepwise oxidation and that, when perturbed, explains the mutants' hmC-stalling phenotype. Our results suggest that the TET2 active site is shaped to enable higher-order oxidation and provide the first TET variants that could be used to probe the biological functions of hmC separately from fC and caC.
