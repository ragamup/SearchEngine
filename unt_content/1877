I haven’t had a chance to practice. I didn’t know . . . I just got this horn. What should I play? What would you like to hear? I didn’t have my instrument/sticks/etc... I didn’t bring any music. Nobody told me . . . Audition Execution: Give yourself plenty of time to do everything (i.e. get up early, have a leisurely meal, arrive early to the audition) Avoid overpracticing, which may cause nerve problems and fatigue Warm up well and practice audition material under tempo At the site, warm up alone and don’t listen to other players Play to your own standards; don’t try to guess how the committee would like something performed Take some risks; communicate the music’s message Maintain a positive appearance even if you do not think you played well Evaluate the audition experience Visit Us Music Building 415 Avenue C Denton, TX 76203-5017 USA Mail Us University of North Texas UNT College of Music 1155 Union Circle #311367 Denton TX 76203-5017 Contact Us 940-565-2791 heather.coffin@unt.edu Technical issues?
