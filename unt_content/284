The Student Government Association exists to serve the students, and by that fact we exist to serve the organizations of the University of North Texas. Organizations help collect like-minded individuals for a common cause, which inherently improve life and study at UNT. SGA works to help connect students to these organizations and help organizations themselves receive funding for their efforts. UNT is still a growing community, and the Student Government Association wants to make sure the many groups at UNT are assisted, financially or otherwise, in enriching the student’s collegiate experience. All you have to do is attend an “SGA Resource” meeting, complete the online application, and attend an Eagle’s Nest Committee meeting to present your proposed program. Spring 2017 Eagle's Nest Applications open January 17th.
