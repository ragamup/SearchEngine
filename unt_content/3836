Following a workflow developed from the initial DataRescuePhilly event at UPenn, we will create trustworthy copies of federal climate change and environmental data. While the Internet Archive has been able to archive many government websites, it is unable to archive other types of information, particularly datasets. DataRescue events are a key piece in ensuring that these datasets are copied. The Internet Archive, datarefuge.org and a consortium of research libraries hold these copies and keep them available for public access.  Data Rescue Denton will be held from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM at Stoke (608 E Hickory St #128, Denton, TX 76205) on Saturday, May 20, 2017.  For more information and to register, please visit datarescuedenton.com.
