Júlia Marques Carvalho da Silva is joining us from Instituto Federal Rio Grande do Sul (IFRS) in Brazil talk about how Smart Teaching Assistants can help.  She will present a set of tools for Moodle that are designed to help teachers use LMS more effectively.  She will also discuss how the tools were developed and how they are being distributed.   This lecture was hosted at The Agora, in room G150, at Discovery Park (3940 North Elm Street, Denton, TX 76207).  It was recorded on Thursday, March 30, 2017 from 12:00—1:30 p.m.         Júlia Marques Carvalho da Silva coordinates the Distance Educational Department at IFRS.  She obtained her Ph.D. from UFRGS in Computers and Education and her post-doctorate at Athabasca University in 2014.   Top Main Menu Home About Us Giving Advising Discovery Series Student Resources Alumni Society Research University Links MyUNT Blackboard EagleConnect UNT Directory UNT Map Jobs at UNT Email & Phone  CI-WebAdmin@unt.edu  940-565-2445 College of Information   3940 N.
