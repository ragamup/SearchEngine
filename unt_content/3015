syllabi and curriculum vitae Alan Baylock (BMEd, Shenandoah Conservatory at Shenandoah University, 1990; MM, UNT, 1995) is quickly becoming recognized as one of the most creative young voices in the music business today. He is in demand as a composer, arranger, conductor, producer, instrumentalist, and educator. Based in Washington, DC, Alan is the chief arranger for the USAF Airmen of Note jazz ensemble (the premier jazz band of the U.S. Air Force) and is the leader of the Alan Baylock Jazz Orchestra (formed in 2001).  The orchestra currently has 6 UNT alums (Antonio Orta, BM; Luis Hernandez, BM; Tyler Kuebler, BM/MM; Doug Morgan, BM; Ben Patterson, BM; Jeff Martin, BM).  Since 2012, Baylock has been jazz composer-in-residence at Shenandoah University, where he teaches jazz arranging and jazz pedagogy and co-directs the conservatory jazz ensemble.  Mr. Baylock's music has been performed and/or recorded by jazz greats Maynard Ferguson, Doc Severinsen, Arturo Sandoval, Joe Lovano, Kurt Elling, Freddie Hubbard, Michael Brecker, Phil Woods, David Liebman, Jerry Bergonzi, Bobby Shew, Kenny Werner, Paquito D'Rivera, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Kenny Werner, JKoshua Redman, Nicholas Payton, Nnenna Freelon, Tierney Sutton, and many more. His eclectic talents have also led him to writing music for Roy Clark, Lee Greenwood, Wynonna, Al Jarreau, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, Spyro Gyra, Ronan Tynan, and symphony orchestras here and abroad. An inspiring educator, Alan continues to write music for high school and collegiate level jazz ensembles, much of which is published by Alfred.  Alan is regularly featured as guest artist, clinician and adjudicator at jazz festivals, universities and high schools across the country.  Two Seconds to Midnight, the debut recording of the Alan Baylock Jazz Orchestra (ABJO), was released in October 2003 on Seabreeze Records. After receiving international critical acclaim, the CD spent eight weeks on the JazzWeek national jazz radio top 40 chart. In January 2007, the Airmen of Note released Out in Front, a recording that features 13 of Mr. Baylock's arrangements. The ABJO released Eastern Standard Time in 2008 and Prime Time with Doc Severinsen in 2014.  "Alan Baylock has achieved a goal that many artists aspire to, but often fail to reach: he has developed his own distinct sound as a composer. His writing is fresh, and is imbued with a great sense of spirit and fun" (Gordon Goodwin, Grammy & Emmy Award-winning composer/bandleader).  Baylock’s mastery of the art of jazz arranging and composition expresses itself in his incomparable technique, staggering virtuosity, and an unquenchable desire to challenge and surprise. Along with explosive energy, ingenious re-harmonizations, imaginative melodic, tonal and rhythmic expressions, Alan’s creations beam with a sense of joy and soulfulness, and are a glimpse into the depth of the human spirit.  As a student  at UNT, Baylock was involved in the lab bands, jazz combos, the Jazz Singers and the Gamelan orchestra.  His arrangements were featured on numerous recordings by the UNT One O’Clock Lab Band, and he wrote the Liner Notes for Lab 2008.  Baylock hopes to put the One O’Clock in the spotlight by concentrating on international touring and continuing to record a CD every year. He also hopes to highlight more pieces by student composers and expand the band’s social media presence.  He is a substitute trumpet player for the Airmen of Note.  He has had private study with Kenny Werner, Mike Crotty, and Neil Slater.  During the 2015-2016 academic year, while he completes his military service, Baylock will share the duties of director with Jay Saunders.  Starting in fall 2016, Baylock will assume the director rule of the One O’Clock Lab Band full-time.
