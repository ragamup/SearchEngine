Despite different backgrounds, UNT students have this in common — they work hard and pursue excellence in everything they do. The university has high expectations of students, but it also provides strong resources, such as its 1,500 outstanding faculty, to help them personally and academically. The VPAA is committed to providing the tools and resources necessary for faculty to achieve our mission.
