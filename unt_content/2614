Campaign Development Board Giving to the COE College of Education › CAEP Accreditation Visit CAEP Accreditation Visit Call for Third-Party Comments The College of Education at the University of North Texas is hosting an accreditation visit by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) on April 2016. Interested parties are invited to submit third-party comments to the visiting team. Please note that comments must address substantive matters related to the quality of professional education programs offered, and should specify the party's relationship to the EPP (i.e., graduate, present or former faculty member, employer of graduates). We invite you to submit written testimony to: Site Visitors CAEP 1140 19th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20036 Or by e-mail to: callforcomments@caepnet.org Such comments must be within the specified period and based on the core tenets of CAEP accreditation standards of excellence, which recognize that: In CAEP's performance-based system, accreditation is based on evidence that demonstrates that teacher candidates know the subject matter and can teach it effectively so that students learn. In the CAEP system, units must prove that candidates can connect theory to practice and be effective in an actual P-12 classroom. A professional education unit that is accredited by CAEP is expected to be involved in ongoing planning and evaluation; engaged in continuous assessment and development; ensure that faculty and programs reflect new knowledge, practice, and technologies; and be involved in continuous development in response to the evolving world of education and educational reform. Comments must address substantive matters related to the quality of professional education programs offered, and should specify the respondent's relationship, if any, to the institution (i.e., graduate, present or former faculty member, employer of graduates). Copies of all correspondence received will be sent to the university for comment prior to the review. No anonymous testimony will be considered. Letters of comment should be received no later than December 2015.
