However, those choosing to pay by credit or debit card for the educational expenses billed through Student Accounting will begin paying a 2.7% service fee, effective Jan. 1, 2015. The fee covers the cost to the university for making credit and debit card payments available. UNT will continue to accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express credit and debit cards online for payment. Several payment options remain available without the additional service fee. Payment can be made online with an electronic check, checks can be mailed and cash, checks, cashier’s checks and money orders are accepted at Student Accounting on the first floor of the Eagle Student Services Center. A list of frequently asked questions is listed below. Why is the University assessing a service fee for credit and debit card payments? UNT is committed to providing students a range of options for paying educational expenses. However, providing complimentary credit or debit card payment services has become prohibitively expensive because of the processing fees assessed by the credit card companies and financial institutions. The expense is currently paid by University revenue and reduces funds available for other needs. This change is expected to save nearly $2 million. What is the service fee and how was the percentage established? The service fee is an additional 2.7% of the payment amount. The service fee is the percentage amount charged by the payment processor to cover the cost of credit and debit card transaction fees assessed by the credit card companies and financial institutions. Do other colleges and universities assess a service fee for credit and debit card payments? Yes. Many colleges and universities have implemented a similar convenience or service fee charge for credit and debit card payments. Which credit and debit cards are accepted? UNT accepts Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express for tuition, fees and housing and dining charges. Are debit card payments also charged the service fee? Yes. However, you can pay by electronic check to avoid the service fee. How will the service fee appear on my credit or debit card statement? The service fee will be listed as a separate transaction.
