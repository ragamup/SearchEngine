& Student Accomplishments Join Our Mailing List Contact Us Scholarships University of North Texas Scholarships and Financial Aid The University of North Texas is a comprehensive university that offers many scholarships to help you finance your education, and academic awards can be a very important part of your financial plan.  Many of our prospective and current students compete for academic scholarships, which are awarded on merit and on a first-come, first-served basis to students enrolling in the fall term. We recommend you apply to UNT and the College of Music as early as possible and that you review the information about university funded scholarships and the other types of aid provided by UNT Student Financial Aid and Scholarships.   If you are interested in pursuing a graduate degree, cost does not have to be a barrier to your success. After reviewing the information above, also visit the Toulouse Graduate School for information about a variety of resources available to graduate students. There are also other sources of scholarship aid at UNT that are available to all students.  UNT International annually administers a number of scholarships that are available to both domestic and international students. The UNT Office of Outreach administers the Multicultural Scholastic Award Program (MSA), a scholarship and student retention initiative targeting academically talented students from diverse backgrounds, and the UNT Division of Equity and Diversity sponsors award competitions annually that are open to all students.   College of Music Scholarships The College of Music awards competitive music scholarships based on talent and professional promise. When you apply for admission to the College, your application and audition also serves as the application for music scholarships. If you are an out-of-state student and you are awarded a competitive scholarship of $1,000 or more during the fall (or fall plus spring), you are able to attend UNT at the resident tuition rate for that academic year - including the summer term.  This is true for both music awards and the academic awards mentioned above. Music scholarship recipients and the amount of awards are determined by faculty committees established from within the appropriate areas. Program needs are also considered in determining scholarship awards. Assuming all scholarship obligations are met each year, scholarships may be held for up to a total of four years for undergraduate study, two years for master’s level study, two years for the completion of a graduate artist certificate, or three years for doctoral study. Of course, award renewal is subject to the availability of funding.  The college currently distributes over $900,000 in music scholarships to students each year. If you receive a performance scholarship, you are required to participate in appropriate performing ensembles each long semester, and must agree to accept assignment by the College of Music in no more than two performance laboratory ensembles each semester. If you receive a non-performance music scholarship, you are required to enroll in appropriate courses as determined by your area. All scholarship recipients must enroll full-time and meet minimum grade point average requirements. Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA in music courses, 2.5 overall. Graduate students must a minimum 3.5 GPA.   Music Award Opportunities There are over 200 separate scholarship opportunities administered by the College of Music that provide funding to music students.  With the exception of six awards*, application materials beyond the admission/renewal application are not required. In accordance with university policy and state law, a complete listing of those awards follows. *Presser Foundation Graduate Scholarship, Presser Foundation Undergraduate Scholarship, Anna Harriet Heyer Scholarship, Pi Kappa Lambda Scholarship, Margot Winspear Opera Scholarship, Clyde Miller French Horn Scholarship.  Awards announced each spring. Requires faculty nomination and application packet or separate audition.
