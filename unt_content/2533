We are the first optical office located on any college campus in the state of Texas. The office is passionate about promoting eye health care for the students, faculty and staff of UNT. Our focus is to educate and provide preventive eye care and healthy maintenance to ensure each patient's vision will be maintained for the future. It is our vision to always provide quality care, honest service and proper treatment to each patient while providing highly technical and personal care. UNT AFFILIATION DISCOUNT  It is common for people to become preoccupied and overlook the importance of vision in their daily lives. It is even more common for people, particularly students to sacrifice healthcare in exchange for saving costs. However, in many situations, visual health will only decline and the longer a person ignores proper treatment, it can potentially INCREASE the overall cost in the long run. For that very reason, College Optical Express at UNT is granting a substantial discount for all UNT affiliated patients with proper identification. This includes current students, faculty, staff, alumni as well as UNT affiliated family members. Please call us at 940-369-7441 if you have any other questions.
