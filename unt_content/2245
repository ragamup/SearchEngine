All residents are expected to be familiar with and abide by the policies, procedures, and standards established in the Handbook as well as the Terms and Conditions of the Housing contract. As members of the larger University community, residents remain subject to the requirements of the UNT Code of Student Conduct and all federal, state and local laws. Violations of the policies, procedures, and standards established in the Handbook will be handled through the residence hall disciplinary procedures. If a student commits a violation of the Code of Student Conduct, the residence hall staff will refer the potential violation the Dean of Students office for further consideration. Housing policies, procedures, and standards may be amended at any time to reflect current university policies, administrative regulations and procedures, amendments to state and/or federal law and fee changes. Amendments are made by the authority of the Director of Housing and are effective upon approval of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Information provided in this handbook is subject to change without notice and does not constitute a contract between the University and a student, an applicant for housing, or any other individual.
