Successful completion of graduate courses by non-degree or certification-only students does not obligate the university to grant admission to a degree program at a later date.As a non-degree student, you may not be eligible for financial aid.  Contact Student Financial Aid and Scholarships for more details.Teacher’s CertificationCheck out the College of Education for details about various certification options. Apply online and follow the application steps in the Graduate Admissions page.Graduate Academic CertificateGraduate Academic Certificates enhance existing bachelor's or graduate degrees in ways that will make the University a life-long center of graduate education.  Courses are taken for graduate credit at the post-baccalaureate and post-master's levels. Apply online and follow the application steps in the Graduate Admissions page.However, Graduate Academic Certificates do not substitute for existing master's or doctoral programs or duplicate such existing programs. Completed Graduate Academic Certificates are listed on students' official transcripts.For more information on certificates, see our gainful employment certificate disclosures.Concurrent Admission: Degree Program (Master's or Doctoral) and Graduate Academic Certificate ProgramConcurrent programs are defined as programs (degrees, graduate academic certificates or teacher certification) that a student is pursuing simultaneously.Admission to a degree program does not imply admission to a Graduate Academic Certificate program. Students who have not completed an application specifically for the Graduate Academic Certificate must complete the Application for Concurrent Graduate Academic Certificate Programs (in addition to the Certificate Verification form completed by the department) for each certificate sought. The following notes apply:The application can be used by either domestic or international students;The application does not require an admission fee;The application is valid for admission to a Graduate Academic Certificate only and cannot be used to seek admission to a second degree program (i.e., master’s or doctoral programs)The application should be sent to the Graduate School and should not be sent to International Admissions, even for international students.The  Application for Concurrent Graduate Academic Certificate Programs must be submitted before the department completes the Certificate Verification form.Tips for Students Admitted to a Graduate Academic CertificateAdmission to a degree program does not imply admission to a Graduate Academic CertificateAlways contact the director of the individual graduate academic certificate for specific requirements for admission to the program. A few of the Graduate Academic Certificates do require an admission test score.At the beginning of your last semester of coursework for the Graduate Academic Certificate, the student must contact the certificate director so a verification form can be submitted by the department.All coursework used toward a graduate academic certificate must be taken at UNT.The Graduate Academic Certificate can be awarded no later than 4 years from the date of the first course.UNT coursework applied to a previously awarded master’s degree (at UNT or elsewhere) cannot be used toward a Graduate Academic Certificate. So if you are seeking a UNT degree and a Graduate Academic Certificate concurrently (at the same time), the Graduate Academic Certificate must be awarded no later than the semester you graduate with your master’s degree.If you intend to seek a Master's or Doctoral degree in addition to a Graduate Academic Certificate or teacher certificate, you will need to apply separately for each program you intend to pursue.
