The lecture will be streaming live!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MlnNDjHDAY Hosted in G165 (The Agora Space) at Discovery Park (3940 North Elm Street, Denton, TX 76207). Ample parking available! Free food and drinks. For millennia, painted portraits were the primary method used to record a person’s presence in time.  It was an expensive and time consuming process that was used as an expression of power that the average person had limited access to.  Nowadays, the majority of people can and do take a photograph at any time with ease.  The concept of ‘selfies’ has been riddled with controversy and ridicule for years, although they have gained near acceptance recently.   Brian O’Connor will dig past the sensationalism into the real world of public knowledge.  Selfies are used as a lens to frame the radical changes occurring in the worlds of production and use of knowledge.  The ease of creation and sharing of selfies means that there is a multitude of data available to wade through and even more conclusion to draw. What is public vs private knowledge?  What constitutes publication? What does authorship entail? Brian O’Connor began making photographs as a kid in the 1950s. He studied Greek & Latin literature at Dartmouth, holds a master's degree in film from Montclair State, has  several years of documentary production experience, and holds a Ph.D. from Berkeley in theory of information retrieval.  Collaborations with close friends and colleagues have  yielded publications in several arenas dealing with images, representation, and questions.  Brian is a professor in the Department of Information Science and co-founding director of the Visual Thinking Lab.      Discovery Series 7: Brian O'Connor [Exposition: Know Thy Selfie: Provocations on Digital Photography & Public Knowledge] Discovery Series 6: Michelle Yang [Workshop: The Art of Visual Notetaking] Discovery Series 5: Júlia Marques Carvalho da Silva [Exposition: Smart Teaching Assistants: Helping Teachers to Help Students] Discovery Series 4: Round Table featuring Berner Lindström [Round Table Discussion: Digitalization of Education in Scandinavia] Discovery Series 3: Robin James Mayes [Exposition: Preventing Plagiarism] Discovery Series 2: Miguel Nussbaum [Exposition: How far are we from teaching creatively?] Discovery Series 1: Rory McGreal, UNSECO Chair in Open Educational Resources [Exposition: Open Education Resources and the Future of Education] Top Main Menu Home About Us Giving Advising Discovery Series Student Resources Alumni Society Research University Links MyUNT Blackboard EagleConnect UNT Directory UNT Map Jobs at UNT Email & Phone  CI-WebAdmin@unt.edu  940-565-2445 College of Information   3940 N.
