syllabi and curriculum vitae Ana White is Senior Academic Counselor for the University of North Texas College of Music Undergraduate Advising Office.  She joined the UNT family in 2006 and has worked as an advisor in the UNT College of Arts & Sciences as well as the UNT Mayborn School of Journalism.  Previously, Ana advised students in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She is the recipient of the UNT Student Success Award (2017), UNT Staff Contribution Award (2014), UNT Star Performer Award (2008), and serves on the University Advising Guidebook and Advisor Recognition Committees.  Ana is an active member of the National Academic Advising Association, and has presented at regional and national conferences. Ana’s passion for college student success stems from her undergraduate experience as a first-generation college student at Angelo State University where she earned a B.A. in Theatre.  She completed a M.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies (Counseling, Communication Studies and Educational Psychology) from UNT while working as a full time advisor.  Although her clarinet-playing and flag-twirling came to a halt after high school, she loves working with music majors and seeing them excel beyond their own expectations.  “It’s absolutely fascinating to see these talented individuals develop into professional-minded musicians and educators.” In her spare time Ana enjoys cooking and singing along to 80s hair bands on her commute to work.
