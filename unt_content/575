The U.S. Department of Education requires institutions offering distance education to provide enrolled and prospective students the contact information to file complaints with the institution’s accrediting agency and with an appropriate state agency in the student’s home state. A UNT student with a complaint should first follow the UNT complaint policy. If UNT does not resolve the problem to the student’s satisfaction, the student may file a complaint with the designated agency in the state where they are receiving instruction or with UNT’s accrediting agency using the contact information provided below. For Students within Texas: Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) (512) 427-6200 or via Email Form Please review the THECB’s Frequent Asked Questions website regarding their complaint process prior to initiating contact. For Students Enrolled in UNT Distance Education and Off-Campus Courses or Programs Outside of Texas: In its July 2012 ‘Dear Colleague’ letter, the USDOE, made a change in the requirement to provide both current and prospective students with contact information for third-party complaint processes. Institutions may now post a link from their web site directly to the SHEEO Complaint Process Report and WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE with the requirement to inform each student of the complaint processes in the state in which the student is receiving the distance education course. Complaints should be filed in the state where the student is receiving instruction, not in the state in which the student resides. A list of complaint processes for each state is provided below. When a link to complaint process is not available, a link to the agency responsible for higher education in that state has been provided instead.
