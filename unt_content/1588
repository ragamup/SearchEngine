Throughout the year, organizations sponsor a variety of extra and co-curricular activities for the campus community as well as participate in service projects on and off campus. In addition, student organizations provide a means for students to develop and refine leadership skills and to interact and network with their peers and with faculty and staff. Joining a student organization gives you opportunities to expand and enhance your overall educational experience, improve your social life, gain self confidence, acquire leadership skills and learn how to function as a member of a group or a team. Getting involved in student organizations can be one of the greatest, most rewarding experiences you will have while you are in college.
