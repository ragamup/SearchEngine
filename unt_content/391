Alumni Corporations & Foundations Faculty & Staff Friends Parents & Families Follow Us Parents and Families Each year, parents help ensure the richness and diversity of the UNT student experience through support for scholarships, research, programs and campus life.  Parents who give back demonstrate the importance of philanthropy to their sons and daughters—a lesson we hope sets a precedent for their students’ future support as proud alumni. Parents and family members of UNT students are among our university’s best champions, contributing thousands of dollars to a wide array of initiatives. Those gifts have an immediate impact on today’s students.
