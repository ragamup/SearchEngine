Will I need a permit to park on campus? Yes, we are a 24/7 permit enforced campus. New faculty and staff members will need to purchase a permit from the Transportation Services Office. Permit options for faculty and staff include: "A" Faculty and Staff Permit (Green Permit)   “A” Reserved permits may only be purchased by full-time faculty and staff members. Faculty and staff on  sabbatical are also eligible for these permits if they purchase the permit for the duration of the sabbatical; these customers will be moved to the bottom of the corresponding waiting list if they do not purchase a permit for the duration of their sabbatical. "A" Reserved permit holders may park their vehicle in their designated space or lot, or any "FS” or “Eagle” space. The subleasing of "A" reserved parking spaces is prohibited. Enforcement periods and parking zone privileges for "A" spaces are indicated in Appendix A. Reserved “A” spaces and lots are enforced 7:00am to 5:30pm, Monday – Friday when the University is open. Vehicles parked in a reserved parking lot or space without the appropriate permit are subject to being cited, impounded, or immobilized immediately. After 5:30pm, unauthorized vehicles will be towed. The towing fee is issued as a separate citation. The fees can be found in Appendix C - . “F/S” Faculty/Staff Permit Holders (Blue Permit) This permit is for faculty and staff members and non-UNT employees working on campus in support of UNT operations. Enforcement periods and parking zone privileges for “FS” lots and spaces are indicated in Appendix A - . • “TF”, “A”, “HD”, Visitor, and specialty permits indicating “FS” spaces are honored in “FS” spaces. • “FS” spaces located within the resident parking areas are enforced 24/7 and are identified by signs. “TF” Teaching Fellow Permit Holders (Black, Yellow, or Purple Permit) This permit is sold by the semester to Teaching Fellows. Each department will need to provide a list of current Teaching Fellows to Transportation Services for verification.

Who is eligible for payroll deduction? Only full-time faculty and staff members are eligible for payroll deduction. Part-time faculty and staff members will need to pay the full permit cost upon purchase. 3. What information will I need to purchase a permit? To purchase any of our faculty and staff permits, you must be listed in our system as a faculty & staff member. This requires your employer to update your status in the university’s system. If your employer hasn’t updated your status in the system yet, you will need to bring your offer letter with you for verification of employment. Individuals wanting to purchase a permit will also need to bring their drivers license and know their license plate number for our records.
