In addition to the university admission requirements, applicants must meet the following minimum requirements for admission to the College of Visual Arts and Design: Freshman applicants must have a verbal SAT score of 450 or higher, or a English ACT score of 18 or higher. Transfer applicants with more than 30 hours must have a cumulative GPA of 2.25 or higher. Admission to the college through this process does not guarantee acceptance into your chosen major, as several programs have entry reviews and all have midpoint reviews that must be passed in order to complete the program.  Students who are admitted into the College will be classified as pre-majors and will be advised by Student Services in Art. To be admitted to the major (and be eligible to enroll in advanced art program courses), a pre-major must meet all the requirements listed for their chosen major.
