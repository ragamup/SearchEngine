The Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) encourages faculty in all areas to pursue diverse funding sources. OGCA helps with the grant application process as well as the review and submission of proposals. Each grant or research related proposal may have specific guidelines that vary in complexity, and it may be a challenge to track and comply with these requirements. Grants and Contracts specialists work with Principal Investigators to administer and shepherd projects to completion; they help manage a broad spectrum of sponsored project related tasks, including pre-award administration, management of agreements and contracts, award administration and close-out, as well as financial reporting. Faculty and staff who conduct sponsored project activities on behalf of the University of North Texas (UNT) are fiscal stewards and, as such, have a responsibility to manage projects according to the sponsor terms of award, applicable Federal and/or State regulations, and UNT policies. Knowledgeable staff help ensure that grants are administered appropriately and in accordance with the unique set of guidelines that govern each project, which assists the researcher to stay focused on carrying out and completing their project objectives.
