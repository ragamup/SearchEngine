Wearing your cap and gown marks your entry into the world as a proud college graduate. Academic regalia is a ceremonial tradition -- and UNT brings its own flourish to this tradition. UNT graduates wear regalia featuring UNT's green school color to clearly distinguish them as graduates of UNT, home of the Mean Green, and proud UNT alumni. UNT's regalia differs by the type of degree a graduate earns -- bachelor's, master's or doctoral. And there are different colored tassels for baccalaureate candidates to distinguish graduates by college.
