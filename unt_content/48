While the government provides data of great value to citizens, companies, and organizations, currently much of the web and social media is also publicly available, providing additional sources of data that have been used, sometimes contrary to the intentions of content creators. This year's symposium will examine issues arising from the creation, harvesting, and analysis of public data—and decision-making based on that data—taking a broad view of what kinds of data are “public.”Registration includes attendance at pre-conference workshops on Thursday, May 18, on preparing data using OpenRefine and using data from the US Census Bureau, and attendance on Friday, May 19, for presentations and panel discussions from speakers from the Center for Research Libraries, UCLA, US Patent and Trademark Office, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Census Bureau, NASA, Esri, and various libraries and museums.
