Beginning Summer 2017, the College of Business will launch the full-time MBA in Business Management. This unique MBA program is specifically designed as a fifth year of study for students completing a 4-year bachelor’s degree at UNT in any discipline – not just business. The MBA in Business Management is a daytime program starting in Summer of 2017 and finishing in Spring of 2018. It is a one year intensive full-time program to help our university’s graduates become the more industry ready and marketable! Further, a waiver of the GMAT/GRE will be granted for students with a bachelor degree from UNT with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher. The curriculum for this new and innovative program relies heavily on experiential learning, teamwork and industry interaction. It is designed in a lock-step and highly intensive cohort structure and is built around student-industry interaction. The larger goal of this program is to develop and nurture future managers and business leaders who become change agents. The program not only exposes students to explicit knowledge about various aspects of business, but also helps students translate this knowledge into tacit knowledge and capabilities. We would like to help you begin your journey to better career through our MBA program! Please complete the form below and we will be in touch with additional information soon.
