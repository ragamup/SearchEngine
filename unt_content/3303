Students learn not only about what they would like to pursue as a career but also what they may wish not to pursue. Depending on budget constraints, the TAMS Academic Office can provide some scholarship support for students who choose to pursue summer research projects. The research experience provides an excellent source of information for the preparation of papers and essays that are part of the scholarship and university application process.
