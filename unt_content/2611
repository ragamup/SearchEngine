Campaign Development Board Giving to the COE College of Education › Scholarships Scholarships Students within the College of Education have access to scholarships that are specific to the College of Education. Scholarships will be awarded to students majoring within the College of Education on the basis of their educational and professional goals, academic success, and financial need. There are four academic departments within the College of Education, and each department administers scholarships for students within that department.  There are also scholarships administered by the College of Education that are not specific to a department. High performing new freshmen or transfer students to the University of North Texas who are entering one of the College of Education undergraduate degree programs can apply for a prestigious Terry Scholarship. These competitive scholarships cover all educational costs for freshmen and transfer students so you can focus on your educational and personal success and graduate debt-free.
