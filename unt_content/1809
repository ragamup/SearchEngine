area at the University of North Texas provides private instruction for the complete spectrum of the brass area with specialists-teachers in all brass instruments (trumpet, baroque trumpet, horn, natural horn, trombone, bass trombone, euphonium and tuba). The College of Music at the University of North Texas is unique in that there are full time faculty in all of these instruments. The distinguished faculty includes internationally known teachers with extensive professional performance careers in addition to their outstanding teaching skills. Private instruction is offered with this purpose: "Applied study in the brass area is designed to develop the highest standards of personal musicianship, professional conduct and performance ability and will provide a broad knowledge of repertoire and musical skills for each student." Each week there are departmental meetings where students in each instrument meet together with faculty for studio classes, recitals and to hear guest artists. Brass students are frequently winners of international competitions and auditions. Alumni are in performing organizations and teaching positions also throughout the world.
