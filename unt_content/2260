What does that mean? Returning students and upperclassmen that are interested in living on campus for the 2017 - 2018 year that have yet to complete a Housing application can add themselves to the Assignment Queue (AQ) by completing the application and making their housing pre-payment (and application fee as applicable).  Those students that are on the Assignment Queue will be assigned as space for returning and upperclassmen students becomes available. Some important things to note about the AQ: 1. The AQ application does not allow you to specify a hall or room type preference. ◦ At the point you reach the top of the AQ, you will be assigned to the next space that is available for use. 2. The AQ application requires full payment of the pre-payment and housing application fee in order to take your spot in line on the actual AQ. ◦ You won’t be assigned a number on the AQ until you make the payment to complete your application 3. Students can review their position and progress on the AQ through the Assignment Queue Status link in eHousing. ◦ Once you complete the application, you will be able to find out where you fall in line on the AQ. 4. Students that want to cancel an AQ application must contact Housing to do so. ◦ If you decide to secure off-campus housing, it is your responsibility to contact UNT Housing to cancel your AQ application and avoid assignment to a room assigned. Housing will discuss the refund process individually with students that wish to cancel from the AQ. While we hope to be able to accommodate everyone, there is a possibility that not all of the returning and upperclassmen students that complete an AQ application will be able to be assigned to Housing for the coming year.  With that being a possibility, exploring other off-campus housing options may be in your best interest to avoid being without living arrangements in August.
