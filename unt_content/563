Transfer students have until June 1 to apply. The Office of Outreach leads college planning initiatives, targeted recruitment initiatives, and retention initiatives that impact underrepresented students at each phase of the P-16 education pipeline: elementary, middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  We recognize students from low-SES and first generation college families are often least likely to receive college information and our unique programs and initiatives introduce students and families to the college/university experience through collaborations with local/regional school districts and community organizations. Outreach programs create a college-going culture to empower students to continue their education beyond high school.  Outreach initiatives cultivate curiosity about UNT’s academic majors, campus culture, and enrollment qualifications.  This approach enables Outreach to cultivate and recruit students from high schools, middle schools and elementary schools within matriculation feeder paths.  Our efforts uniquely impact UNT’s Core Values of access, collaboration, diversity, engagement and service. The Office of Outreach is a component of UNT Admissions and resides in the Division of Enrollment.
