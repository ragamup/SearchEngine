Dubois holds a Bachelor of Music degree, magna cum laude, and Master of Music degree from the University of Southern California where she studied with Donald McInnes.  A former teaching assistant of Karen Tuttle at The Juilliard School, Dubois earned the Doctor of Musical Arts degree and was awarded the William Schuman Prize for outstanding achievement and leadership in Music. Dubois has extensive experience as a recitalist and chamber musician, performing and coaching throughout the United States, South America, Australia, Italy, and most recently, Portugal, South Korea and South Africa.  She has appeared at music festivals such as  Marlboro and La Jolla with such notable artists as Lynn Harrell, David Soyer, David Finkel, Donald Weilerstein, Menahem Pressler, and Atar Arad. Formerly the principal violist of the Dallas Opera Orchestra, Dubois is currently a member of the artist faculty and string-area coordinator at the University of North Texas and serves on the summer faculty of the International Festival -Institute at Round Top and the Green Mountain Chamber Music Festival.
