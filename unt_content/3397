The more potent a university is, the more it develops the region around it." — President Neal Smatresk UNT is ranked among the nation’s 115 top-tier research universities, according to 2015 Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education™. Tier One status is defined, in part, by how a university ranks in the Carnegie Classification, which is a leading framework for measuring institutional characteristics. UNT’s official Carnegie classification is R1 Doctoral University with the highest research activity, which is Carnegie’s top classification for research universities. This achievement is commonly considered the most significant step in the evolution of a research university and marks a key milestone in UNT’s commitment toward national prominence. Read the announcement about the new designation. Tier One universities are regarded as the top universities, known for their academic and research excellence. They attract top students and faculty, drive innovation and technology through high-level research and scholarship, and contribute significantly to the region and state through intellectual capital and economic development. Read President Smatresk's Dallas Innovates column about how UNT drives progress as a top-tier research university. UNT officials noted that the latest Carnegie rankings give strong consideration to UNT’s impact as a broad-based research institution that awards a large number of doctoral degrees each year. UNT consistently leads the region and ranks among the state’s top universities for the number of doctoral degrees it awards annually. UNT has a strong foundation with a broad base of research and scholarship across many disciplines from the arts to education to political science. UNT is fast becoming a research hub for plant science, renewable energy technologies, bioproducts, computational research, materials science and engineering, and logistics.  Learn more about faculty research, achievements and breakthroughs.   Initiatives & Priorities Top-Tier Research University Planning Implementation Talon Team Follow @UNTPrez UNT Insider President's News Roundup Learn more about UNT Partner with UNT University Awards Give nowUNT's Impact Report Visit Us Office of the President Hurley Administration Building Room 201 [map] Mail Us Office of the President University of North Texas 1155 Union Circle #311425 Denton, Texas 76203-5017 Contact Us 940-565-2108 president@unt.edu   Disclaimer| AA/EOE/ADA| Privacy| Electronic Accessibility| State of Texas Online| Emergency Preparedness| THECB Online Resume System Student Consumer Information| UNT Compliance Hotline| Governors Committee on People with Disabilities| Texas Veterans Portal| UNT Home
