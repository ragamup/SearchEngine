As the culmination of your outstanding hard work, your thesis or dissertation represents the final step towards earning your Master’s or Doctoral degree.The process isn’t as daunting as you may have heard! View the links below to learn more about the process.Openness and Distribution of Electronic Theses & Dissertations (ETDs)The University of North Texas (UNT), as a member of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), endorses the fundamental tenet on openness and access of thesis and dissertation research as stated in the CGS policy manual The Doctor of Philosophy Degree: A Policy Statement (CGS, 2005).In compliance with CGS, it is the policy at UNT that “an essential aspect of [thesis] and dissertation research and scholarship is the free and full dissemination of research results. Restrictions, either in the conduct of [thesis] and dissertation research or in the sharing of its results, are antithetical to that spirit.”As part of UNT’s commitment to openness, all UNT ETDs are placed in the UNT ETD repository and made available via the online UNT Libraries catalog for reading and/or downloading by all users, including being crawled and indexed by online search engines (e.g., Google). ETDs are available in perpetuity; in addition, there are no restrictions regarding who can download the file or how many times it can be downloaded.The UNT Thesis Manual: Formatting the Dissertation/ThesisYour first stop when formatting your dissertation or thesis should be our Thesis & Dissertation Manual. Additionally, we have many resources in our Writing section that can provide you with insight on copyright issues, plagiarism, style guides and the like.Ready to Submit?The Toulouse Graduate School (TGS) and the UNT Libraries are pleased to announce the implementation of an online thesis/dissertation submission tool called Vireo. All materials that used to be hard copy will now be handled electronically in Vireo – this includes filing forms, major professor’s document approval, ProQuest forms, copyright permissions, journal samples, restriction approval, etc.Please review all the information below to aide you in successfully submitting your thesis or dissertation.IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER:The thesis or dissertation you upload in Vireo must be a single PDF file, and must include all committee-, department- and/or college-level edits.  It must be the absolute final version.  Once you confirm final submission, Vireo will prevent subsequent submissions.Be sure to review the UNT Vireo Submission Guide before beginning the submission process.You do not need to complete the entire submission process in one sitting; however, the entire process must be completed and confirmed by the submission deadlines.Student name fields will automatically populate directly from your official UNT records.  This is how your thesis/dissertation will be cataloged through the UNT Libraries Digital Collection and the Texas Digital Library.  For this reason, you must use the UNT official records name on the title and copyright pages of the thesis/dissertation.Once a submission has been completed and confirmed, an email will automatically be sent to the major professor to confirm the submitted version is the final approved version.  The email will contain a link back to Vireo; your major professor will need to log in and approve the file.  This takes the place of the (hard copy) Document Approval Form.ProQuest submission in Vireo is optional.  However, because Vireo is an online submission application, the student fee associated with ProQuest submission (known as the “microfilm fee”) no longer exists.  If you need more information before deciding whether to submit to ProQuest, please discuss this option with your professor and colleagues.If you have opted to restrict access to the UNT copy and/or embargoed the ProQuest copy, the confirmation email sent to your major professor will also include this information.  S/he will need to approve the restriction/embargo selection, in addition to confirming the uploaded version is the final committee-approved version. SubmissionVireo was designed to be very user friendly, and students should not have much trouble figuring out what to do in order to successfully submit.UNT Vireo Submission GuideThe Texas Digital Library has created a short instruction video, which you may find helpful to view prior to logging in.
