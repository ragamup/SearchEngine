Interaction and user experience design are at the heart of human-centered design. Everything from mobile devices to large-scale computing networks can and often needs to be re-imagined and redesigned to improve performance, engagement and usability. With a master’s degree in design focused in interaction design from UNT, you will acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to launch and sustain a career in interaction design (IXD) or user experience design (UXD). You’ll learn how to create, introduce and maintain innovative products, systems and services with the user in mind. IX and UX design processes are built on understanding and leveraging connections between design, the social sciences, marketing and logistics, and the computing sciences to create experiences that people find useful and meaningful. Taking courses in this new master’s program at UNT’s New College at Frisco will place you in the heart of a thriving IXD and UXD job market. The Plano/Frisco/Dallas-area is among the Top 20 most lucrative markets in North America for people who possess IXD- and UXD-based knowledge and job skills. The M.A. in Design with a focus in Interaction Design, offered through UNT’s College Visual Arts and Design, is the only one of its kind in the North Texas region.
