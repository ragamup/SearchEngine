Hall. Set the Stage for Success The UNT College of Music became home to the nation’s first jazz degree in 1946 and—with nine big bands, four vocal jazz ensembles, more than a half-dozen specialty jazz ensembles and approximately 25 small groups—the program continues to thrive today. The Sound of Innovation We are internationally recognized as a hub of innovation. Our Center for Experimental Music and Intermedia (CEMI) enables composers to explore the integration of music and art technologies with state-of-the-art support for research, creative work, performance and teaching. We offer clinical services as well as have opportunities for advanced research in music and medicine through the Texas Center for Performing Arts Health. Acclaimed and Dedicated Faculty With more than 100 full-time faculty members—including Grammy Award winners, a Van Cliburn International Piano Competition winner, Guggenheim Fellows and soloists with internationally-renowned operas and symphony orchestras—you will learn from some of the top musicians in the world. With one of the largest early music programs in the country, UNT offers you access to period instruments and private instruction with specialized faculty who have the skills to develop virtually any repertoire. Unparalleled Resources You may have the opportunity to study and perform music abroad, as well as the ability to explore distant cultures through on-campus world music ensembles. You will have access to on-campus instrument repair shops for wind, brass and stringed instruments that provide low-cost quick fixes or major repairs. Over 300,000 volumes of books, hundreds of reference works, a wide variety of online materials and an estimated one million sound recordings will be available to you through the UNT Music Library, one of the most extensive music collections in the United States.
