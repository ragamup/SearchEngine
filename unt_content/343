UNT is committed to the creation and advancement of innovative research, art and scholarship. One of the primary responsibilities of this office is to develop and implement strategies in collaboration with the Office of the Provost and other vice presidential areas to transform and expand UNT's research enterprise. One area that reflects ORI’s vision in the continued development of initiatives is the Strategic Plan for Research, UNT’s ten year plan towards becoming a national research university. Last year, UNT became part of an elite group of research institutions and is now classified as an R1 Doctoral University with the highest research activity, according to the Carnegie Classification. What’s just as notable are the breakthroughs resulting from work done through our Institutes of Research Excellence, where collaboration is driving innovation. This kind of collaboration — our researchers working together across disciplines, with other universities and industry partners — is the key to making new discoveries and creating solutions that will improve our world and sustain our future.\ We’re also strengthening our research enterprise and culture by investing in our people, programs and spaces. These investments foster an environment for innovative research, scholarship and creativity that help our faculty to make important advances in health, agriculture, energy use and more. This year alone, our researchers made game-changing discoveries in the fight against breast cancer and in materials design. Research partnerships will continue the growth of innovation at UNT. We’re adding high-impact faculty, investing in graduate education and building our research profile to give our students world-class experiences and an education worthy of the next generation of researchers. All of this is taking place in our newly renamed research division, the Office of Research and Innovation, which includes the new Office of Innovation and Commercialization. This signals a new emphasis in increasing our reach across campus, and our support of innovation that can occur in any department, in any classroom, in any setting. Here at UNT there is momentum to grow and evolve, and we’re fostering innovation.
