Development and Diversity Women's Faculty Network (WFN) Tenure and Promotion PROMOTION AND TENURE AT UNT UNT's success and progress depends on the exceptional work of our tenure-system faculty members who set high academic standards and carry out their work at a premier level. The culmination of this hard work is the awarding of tenure and promotion for achieving excellence in teaching, research, and service. As one embarks on the journey toward tenure and/or promotion, we encourage faculty members and those administrators and staff professionals who support them to attend one of our periodic P&T workshops moderated by senior academic administrators such as UNT's provost and president. Of course, it is also important to review carefully the promotion and tenure process, guidelines, and deadlines as provided on this website and within one's college or school. Please contact the applicable college, school, and department for specific guidelines related to the promotion and tenure process, application and resources.  For additional information, please review UNT Policy. Workshop presentation can be downloaded here. To find out more about our events, be sure to check out our Events Calendar!    Visit Us Hurley Administration Bldg 2310 N.
