We would like to thank Associate Dean Baxter and the Search Committee for their efforts in conducting the search and to all of the individuals who participated in the on-campus interview process. Thanks must also go to our colleague Robert Jessup for his leadership during this transition period. An artist working primarily on paper deploying the vocabulary of nature to engage with concepts of intimacy and nostalgia, Lauren has demonstrated herself to be a skilled arts administrator. She is coming to us from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she served as chair of the Department of Art and Art History for the last four years. Prior to that, Lauren worked at the University of Florida as first the Director of Graduate Studies for Studio Art and then the Assistant Director of the School of Art and Art History. University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a founding member of The Alliance for Research Universities (a2ru), an organization among whose ranks UNT has joined this year. In her role as Chair at UAB, Lauren embraced the a2ru mission of interdisciplinary projects and programs through collaborations with the School of Engineering & Business, as well as departments across the College of Arts and Sciences. Her soon to be former Dean referred to her as working “tirelessly to create an inspirational and sustainable department.”  Please join us in welcoming Lauren to our CVAD community!   Visit UsCollege of Visual Arts & Design 1201 W.
