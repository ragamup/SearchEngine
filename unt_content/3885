About This Project The NewsBank/Readex/GODORT/ALA Catharine J. Reynolds award was given to Cathy Nelson Hartman and Valerie D. Glenn in the summer of 2002, to begin the process of capturing Congressional Research Service reports available via the Internet and provide permanent public access to them. Reports were downloaded from a variety of web sites that host CRS reports, either currently or in the past. Many CRS reports are updated on a regular basis, and this site includes all versions of the reports that could be located. When HTML files were captured, a note was inserted at the top of the report indicating from where the files were downloaded. To prevent the need for constant maintenance of files, most external links have been removed. Metadata has been created for each report, including subject terms from the Legislative Indexing Vocabulary, supplemented with Library of Congress Subject Headings. Users have the ability to search by keyword, title, author, subject, and report number.
