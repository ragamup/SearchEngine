The following pages enable you to report violations of federal or state law, Regents Rules or University policy. You can use this system to report compliance violations anonymously. If you choose to provide your name, the confidentiality of your report will be protected to the extent allowed by law.You also will be protected from retaliation for any report that you make in good faith. The University provides this site to encourage you to report violations that will harm the University. After you complete the first page of the set of report forms, you will receive a tracking number. You can use this tracking number to check on the status of your report. Please do not lose this number, as there is no way to request a copy of it at a later date. Please note that anonymous reports may not be sufficient to prosecute certain types of violations, such as discrimination or sexual harassment. However, every report will be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action will be taken to end and remedy violations. If you are the victim of discrimination or abuse, please visit the Office of Equity and Diversity as soon as possible to file a complaint. Â
