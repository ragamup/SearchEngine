Emergency Guidelines The following Emergency Guidelines provide general guidance in the event of an emergency. The guidelines are intended to: provide guidance on first actions to take and how to obtain assistance in the event of an emergency, serve as a useful tool during department safety talks, supplement training provided during new faculty, staff and student orientation, reference as a baseline when creating department/building specific action plans. They are not intended to negate the need to develop custom plans with specific information pertinent to individual departments/buildings or replace the responsibility of faculty, staff and students to become familiar with specific information for their building, office or classroom.  Emergency related information and resources are also available via the “Mean Green Ready” mobile app from UNT Emergency Management. The Mean Green Ready mobile app is designed to support emergency preparedness within the UNT campus community by providing quick and easy access to general emergency guidelines, resources, maps, important numbers and contact information for use by faculty, staff and students. Some specific examples of useful information readily available in the app are building evacuation routes and shelter areas, exact AED locations, emergency phone locations on campus and emergency guidance for select emergency situations such as active shooter, fire, hazardous materials and severe weather.
