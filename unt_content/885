The program also prepares students for medical school if they want to pursue careers as medical examiners. Areas of professional interest in forensic science include chemistry, DNA/genetics, toxicology, anthropology, microscopy, and crime scene investigations. The program consists of 19 hours of forensic science coursework in a wide variety of topics, including Introduction to Criminalistics, Forensic Microscopy and Instrumental Analysis. Students use the same cutting-edge equipment featured in the nation's top crime labs. Facilities include a new criminalistics lab focusing on fingerprint, ballistic and laser analysis. An forensic science internship is also required. Faculty will work closely with students to help them find internships in their areas of professional interest.
