The "Circle of Impact" is the College of Health and Public Service giving club for donors who invest $1,000 or more to PACS programs and scholarships annually. The larger the Circle, the greater the impact! Circle members are added to the dean’s mailing list and invited to special "Circle" events. With the generous support of these donors we are able to invest in our students through scholarships, paid internships, travel opportunities, experiential learning and engaged research.   Answers on Demand* Edward L.
