The faculty members of the Curriculum Committee should be concerned with the academic integrity of the institution, the quality of course and programmatic offerings, and the realization that the institution is diverse and that the academic programs it offers will be similarly diverse. Work with the Oversight Committee on the Core Curriculum, the Academic Affairs Committee, and the Associate Deans in the process of reducing the core curriculum by 5 credit hours. To the greatest extent possible, this reduction should be consistent with faculty values. Core curriculum changes must specify educational objectives as well as assessment measures. Recommendations must be made in a timely manner to the Senate's Executive Committee and the Faculty Senate in order to meet catalog deadlines.
