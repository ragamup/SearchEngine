Failure to comply with these laws can result in severe consequences for UNT as well as for individual researchers, including fines and imprisonment. This website is designed to assist faculty and staff in understanding Export Control laws and provide guidance as to what steps should be taken to ensure compliance. Please review these materials and contact Research Integrity & Compliance if you have any questions or if you wish to schedule training for your department.
