This is accomplished by determining eligibility for qualified students by reviewing disability-related medical and psychological documentation along with the student's individual experiences, to determine appropriate, reasonable accommodations which are recommended to the campus. As part of this process, our office strives to facilitate the development of students through independence and autonomy. UNT is a student centered research institution; our office compliments this mission by providing leadership in the areas of equal access and advocacy for students with disabilities. In turn, our campus diversity will be richer and UNT will be more accessible to all. To find us, simply go directly North of the University Union Building (about 75 yards) and enter the door on the South side of Sage Hall. We are the first office to the left. Accessible parking near us is marked on the map below with the international accessibility symbol.
